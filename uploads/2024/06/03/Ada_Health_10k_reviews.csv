5eba3cac-53ef-4378-b3d1-a817aaf6f82e,Ada Health,Paul Temple,"When Ada works, the medical guidance is excellent. But very basic app controls are missing (standard in similar alps); there is no ""back"" button and no ""restart"" button. This causes users lots of effort when a small mistake is made on answeting questions. It also causes inappropriate Ada requests for button clicks when restarting after a crash. And if Ada crashes just after you ask for a report or while you are reading a teport, say goodbyw to the report. You just have to start again --- ugh!!!",3,1,2023-08-15 19:06:30,"Hi,

I appreciate that it lets you create and save multiple profiles for different people and input their information separately. For me the the only negative would be that sometimes the follow-up questions only have one or two choices for answers, and sometimes the available answers either don't really apply or are not exactly accurate. But overall good app! Would definately recommend!",4,55,2023-05-10 22:52:40,"Hi,

053a1f81-de67-40a2-afdf-b794e8d58c69,Ada Health,Aaron Hancock (Dewblay),I've been down for most of my life and have never wanted to reach out for help because of my random mood swings. I still had that feeling when trying this app until I saw that it went further in depth of what my condition could be or if I have one at all.

I used Ada and instantly received her diagnosis. We called the ambulance again next day. She sadly died in the hospital. Autopsy confirmed what this app said. I also used it for myself, and after I did some tests, I discovered two lumps on my thyroid. App was again pretty spot on. It's good to use in order to see which doctor to visit sooner or what tests to get done first.",5,11,2023-03-05 14:21:17,"Hi,

9b182457-d611-4063-82ea-b1e7aba7e731,Ada Health,Sierra Marquardt,I love this app. It offers detailed symptoms and if you don't understand it offers diagrams and pictures. It asks you to pinpoint areas so it can better diagnose you. It offers several different possible prognosis and thorough explanations as well as the probability of each prognosis. You can track symptoms over a long period of time as well as have several different profiles to track the whole family or friends.,5,78,2022-12-13 01:50:34,"Hi,

Also like that it ask questions after you enter symptoms & then gives in order possible conditions & the percentage of people who had the same symptoms/condition. It gives treatment options and if it's something to watch for progressing symptoms or if you should seek medical help right away to confirm or if symptoms seem severe the way you entered it. Of course it doesn't replace medical advice but gives a starting point.,5,57,2022-12-10 00:58:58,"Hi,

c66f4f85-cea9-413b-8e39-29cc5d793a56,Ada Health,Cristal The Critic,I absolutely love this app and it has never failed me. This app is actually diagnosed my medical conditions well before my very own primary care doctor and specialists have done the job all you have to do is answer several yes or no questions and it will spit out a list of probable medical conditions starting with the most likely one. Not only does it give you the probable medical conditions but it gives you the likelihood for each one. This app is amazing,5,1,2022-06-19 07:33:49,"Hi.

You helped me more than my own Doctor, my Doctor ignores me with some things. My Doctor looks at some things like I'm complaining instead of treatment. Such as when I have IBD flair and in need of assistance with things that can be helpful she doesn't do anything for me and says to tell the IBD team to deal with it. And when I was in so much pain my Doctor ignored it and let me suffer",5,2,2022-05-11 01:51:45,"Hi.

It has helped me numerous times and i would say it is about 95 percent spot on. Certain changes might make it better like replacing yes/no/don't know and mild/moderate/severe with a 10 point grading system might make it a tad easier for us to point out our level of discomfort. Just a suggestion. Anyways lots of love to the creators of this amazing app.,5,0,2022-04-22 00:06:43,"

It has been so helpful for giving me an idea of what might be going on so that I can bring it up to my psychiatrist. I have been so confused about what's been happening to me and Ada suggested BPD and after searching it up it definitely feels right and my psychiatrist has agreed that it definitely could be the case.

However what I will say is: This thing is pretty accurate, less traumatising than a google search which is bound to tell you you have cancer or some other major life threatening diseases or conditions, and is extremely precise and detailed in questions. Good app.",4,29,2022-01-14 23:49:34,"Hi.

5efecf29-aa54-4788-b1f3-fa480c61b39b,Ada Health,Zach Rutledge,"This app has gotten progressively better since it launched. It's a pretty easy to use, straightforward way to narrow down possible issues based on symptoms. A lot of the terminology seems based on British English but it's easy enough to know what they mean when it's something different from American medical malady names. The symptom tracker is nice but it's very slow and difficult to use. It only presents a few symptoms at a time, so trying to update a litany of issues at once is a slow slow slow process. In fact, the whole symptom assessment setup is fairly slow. I'd love to trade some fancy animations for faster performance. Another thing I'd like to see is a daily reminder to do the symptom tracker. Maybe if I did an assessment daily I could have some useful information on ongoing issues?",4,248,2021-10-06 13:34:40,"Hello, thank you for your feedback!

bea753c5-33d1-4998-b179-b533927e80ff,Ada Health,A Google user,The app is very user friendly and helpful. Although the process for suggested diagnosis could be made better by suggesting conditions for related body systems and could be further improved by adding in helpful tips to help a patient heal more quickly or ease their pain if it applies. This could become an all in one emergency aid for people when it's urgently needed.

Both reviews mentioned answering a lot of questions before getting their diagnosis. The app can only help you if you work with it. I took several minutes trying to understand and answer each question. I think I was asked maybe 10-15 questions. Perhaps that's because I had fewer symptoms to assess. However, I believe if you want a tool to work well, one must understand how to use that tool well.",5,8,2019-09-13 23:07:08,,,2.46.4,en,us

A definitive diagnosis can only be arrived at in a hospital setup where appropriate investigations can be done. So one should not expect this app to tell them exactly what is wrong with them. However,the spectrum of differential diagnoses it gives is very good.It compiles the symptoms you have and gives you the possible cause (s) of your symptoms. Ada is good within its capacity. You still have to go to the hospital tho.",4,22,2019-09-07 14:01:49,,,2.46.4,en,us
