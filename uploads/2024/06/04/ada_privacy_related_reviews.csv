Review
It's provide me right information
"This app is amazing! My mom has had some really weird symptoms and big life changes. Her physical health is deteriorating quickly and thanks to Ada, the Drs can see the log of her symptoms. I can bring attention to those conditions they don't think about. It's not like most that scare you right off the top. Ada asks different questions about your symptoms to make sure she gets it right. Thorough and very easy to use. Only reason why not 5 stars. Wish there was a way to preexistng conditions"
I recommend this app you can learn more about your symptoms and conditions to seek the right medical help .. thank you for creating this helpful informative app Yes absolutely you can use my review
"Good info, easy to use ,right on with answers"
"I love using Ada! I know myself pretty well but when I noticed a new concern it never fails I am reminded by the questions she asks of how connected some of my past medical conditions are and how they often affect one another! Ada is not too much, just right! Easy to use and so helpful!"
I love this app !! This app always knows what my diagnosis is before i get it checked and its always right. Would deffo recommend this over searching google and thinking your about to die would 100% recommend to download and use
"Ada is a very efficent, great and easy app to use for home diagnosis and to check over things that don't feel right. Although you can't compare Ada to a professional doctor and/or medical assistant, i'd say it's very accurate and has a variety of options for possible health issues. Ada has helped ease my mind a little when it comes to my Health Anxiety (Hypochondria) and Different anxieties I have, which has helped me sleep and night and feel mentally comfortable. I fully recommend it."
"Diagnosed a chronic condition I didnt known I had, confirmed by a doctor. Amazingly accurate when you provide enough valuable information"
"Ada app was simple and quick. I have already seen a proffesional for my symptoms(still waiting for results and treatment plan) but i wanted a second opinion. My physician informed me they suspect hypothyroidism(along with calcium and plaque buildup in my arteries) and Ada pegged it right on. Easy to use, easy to understand. Navagating Ada was simple and to the point, while navigating the app i felt like it was asking the right questions. I'm very happy to have downloaded and used Ada. Thank you"
Ada can do anything! I tested it on all the most uncommon and rare illnesses and it got them all right. Ada is brilliant and easy to use. I love it~
Excellent information provide this app
Every time I use this app it is pretty right on point
"I really do love it already ,and the information is accurate to based on the symptoms i provide.My new fav....!!!!"
"Helpful information inside the application, provide me guidance to localized the symptoms"
Requests to store and use too much personal information
Its very great app. For easy diagnosis of your symptoms with just few taps. And very easy to use most of the symptoms are ruled out right. Great job guys.
Very good service questions were easy to understand and didn't use those posh medical words. Even a barbarian like me to understand what I was being asked
Really good 😊 This app feels really professional and is eazy to use While the diagnosis isn't always 100% accurate (I'd say it get it right about 80% of the time but your mileage might vary) it always points in the right direction and let's you know if you can take care of things on your own or if you should go see a doctor and for me that is very valuable
"Unable to create an account. The Facebook sign-in button simply doesn't do anything, and signing up with e-mail and password gives me the message that my internet isn't working, both on Wi-Fi and cellular data. It's a shame an account is needed, as I haven't been able to use the app because of it. I've seen multiple reviews about registration not working, how about the option of creating an account through the Ada website instead of the app? Who knows, it might solve the issue."
"I just downloaded and tried this app. I can't see my healthcare providers regularly right now because of Covid-19, so I use this to track my health and any symptoms I have to help me decide if it's worth making an appointment right now or not. I like how it walks you through everything and keeps track for you. For someone like me with chronic medical conditions it helps me keep track of things to discuss with my doctor."
"Exceptional service app, easy to use and guides you throughout the process 👌"
"I wanted to install and use this app but upon setup it asks for permission to sell all of your personal information. It's bad enough when a company shares your data, but when that data refers to your mental health, that's unacceptable. You wouldnt want your doctor selling your personal data."
I always use this app as 9 out of 10 it is always right diagnosis I use it for all my children my self and family it's very reliable and very happy with it worth downloading
We could really use a night mode feature right now. Perhaps I can use my default system font. That'd be lovely.
"I put my symptoms in and Adam came up with the right diagnosis straight away, no problem. Very easy to use"
"This application has got some bright future! I really wished for so long to have an application to tell you what is going on with your health and give you information about your health stats! This is incredible! Please dev team, if you are reading this, please add the option to contact or connect to doctors and professionals, and provide them with your past reports and assesments to track your progress. And I am not saying it should be free, of course you have to charge for the appointments! 😄"
This app is very easy and helpful. I love the preciseness of questions. I like to use this app as my personal knowledge and research before I visit a doctor for my disease so I can have a thorough understanding what's happening in my body.
It is perfect for personal health care and is also very easy to use and no it's free no charges
"I love Ada I use it for my kids, myself and my mom! I hardly go to doctors now unless I need antibiotics for something! One time I had to go to er for horrible pain I was having on my right side under rib and I has told the nurses and doctor ""I'm pretty sure it's my gallbladder"" the Dr looked at me shocked and said you're right!"
"Helpful app, I'm enjoying to have Ada, i invite my friends to have this, Simple to use and clear explanations. Thank you"
This app is awesome!! Very personable and clear. Easy to use.
The ia the best app ever for personal health checkup
I love the app its easy to use and gave me an idea on what I may have. But does anyone know any apps I can use for therapy I'm 16 and I don't want my parents to know I need therapy.
If you have the patience to give thoughtful and honest answers to 'lots' of 'drill down' questions the system appears to conclude with very good (multiple) potential diagnoses with good associated background information ...
Very useful app and easy to use
It's a must use app and I strongly recommend it.
Easy to use and uunderstand
Goood i like to use this app than hospitol
I highly recommend to use this app. It's very precise and accurate.
Use all the time
Amazing information 4sure
So far so good. Got some interesting information for what I could have based off my symptoms. Will consult my doctor about them.
"Very very good app to understand symptoms surrounding health. It was actually able to provide a prognosis which saved my eyesight and identify the underlying cause of the issue. If you hate going to the doctor, Ada is very helpful to give you an idea on whether you should see an actual doctor or if something can be managed at home."
Good service and save people who can not what to go hospital like me
Great app for medical assessment. It does not mean you will actually know what you are I'll from. But it will give you enough information to have a close idea of it.
"Great job! I'm fine all right. It was a flu, a little violent one for two days. Covid (rapid test) negative and malaria tests also negative. Only paracetamol was used, a lot off drinking water, eucalyptus infusions, vitamin C, Zinc, Selenium, Vitamin B6, E and D3. Actually gain 2 kg of body weight. Now with 74 Kg. Never lost te appetite, by the contrary. I live in Mozambique but now it's malaria season. There is a lot of Flu going on but everybody only talk about Covid..."
Informed me accurately to make the right decision about my next move whether to consider it serious or not. I am going to take heed to the advise very strongly.
"I tested with something I already have a diagnosis and it gave me the right thing, before going to the one I needed to know more. So seems legit, will go after a doctor now 😅"
I was really impressed because the right questions were asked just the way i was feeling.
"I've been searching for an health assistance app like this, but never find one as good as this one...simple,classy and easy to use with best experience overall...."
A very useful tool. Clear and easy to use. Useful before speaking to doctor.
I've found the app useful particularly when you can't always get to see a doctor. Sometimes it's helpful to give me an idea of what to look for online before I approach clinical staff at 111 etc. There have been times when my GP has sent me away but this app has prompted me to seek a second opinion - and the app was right. 💙
Quick and easy to use.
This has really helped me figure out things of why I have these symptoms I also suggest to use this app.
Very good. Lots of questions and detailed information and answers
"Is 99.9 percent of the time right. my back had been hurting but im only 13 so i was like ""hmmmm"". It asked for my temp so i took it and it was 104.3 . it said i had a kidney infection which had me so scared so i went to the er. it was right and they said it was really bad and if i had waited much longer my kidney could have failed. love you ada ❤"
Am happy to use this app
Is good app to use
"Its pretty easy to use, and i found it awsome"
its very good for its purpose questions take a while to go through
Very easy to use. Please allow dark mode.
"It's good app ever seen, it can give you some possible information of the problem. Really i appreciate it."
Easy to use and understand
Easy to use. Detailed analysis
Good service
VERY HELPFUL INFORMATION
Its good and best app to use plz install this app will help you
"Honestly gave me clarity and I didn't have to pay for it. It's easy to use and fast, the only thing I could say is it didn't really say what medicine you can take."
"I described a fluey cold, and the app, questions, information and advice was good. NB. I think best to describe as a 'fluey cold' eg by an adenovirus and a mild illness. Ie rather than describe as 'flu'... because 'flu' is word also used as short for influenza, which is a more severe condition caused by the seasonal influenza virus."
I recommend Ada to everyone please use this App and you will never regret.
"What WebMD use to be, but in an easy to use app. With 3 kids I'm constantly checking symptoms and this allows me to have a profile for each person and check far and easy. Every parent needs this app."
"i was actaully ignored your app once, but eventually i do appreiate and respct the information provided regarding my problem. thanks ADA"
Easy to use and seemed fairly accurate...
Reasonable base information
"Apparently good considering my first use, however i think it would be better to add pictures to demonstrate the symptoms that are being asked about, i'll give it 3 stars, still waiting for improvements!"
"It's a fantastic health app. It distinguish our health problems by symptoms which we provide it and its report gives us clues (advice) about what's going on with us🤔🤔😊 I feel this app safe, secure and much helpful💝💝 There is no chance to uninstall it 😅✌✌"
Absolutely fantastic.. I have already been diagnosed with one of the conditions the application suggested but I wanted to see how accurate can this application be and it was right on the point. This is amazing.
Cannot use up without signing up so download - useless - delete.
It is very easy to use and very helpful
Incredible... it was really helpful and when I was describing my symptoms the app use to asked me exactly what I was feeling
Excellent and easy to use
Thia app has been right every time it's been used and helped some of my friends and family get diagnosed. Incredibly impressed. Thanks you to the developers.
"If you have any symptoms, that you are not sure of please this is the app to use."
It is good app for a personal who care his/her hygiene. Mostly helpful thanks
I don't use it often but when I have its always been accurate
Detailed information
Really good service
"This app has gotten progressively better since it launched. It's a pretty easy to use, straightforward way to narrow down possible issues based on symptoms. A lot of the terminology seems based on British English but it's easy enough to know what they mean when it's something different from American medical malady names. The symptom tracker is nice but it's very slow and difficult to use. It only presents a few symptoms at a time, so trying to update a litany of issues at once is a slow slow slow process. In fact, the whole symptom assessment setup is fairly slow. I'd love to trade some fancy animations for faster performance. Another thing I'd like to see is a daily reminder to do the symptom tracker. Maybe if I did an assessment daily I could have some useful information on ongoing issues?"
This app is so helpful although does not confirm the diagnosis but give you information which are useful . Thank you !
"I use this app all the time, and it has not disappointed me yet."
This app is accurate and very easy to use
Easy to use and understand. Asks a good amount of pricing questions.
Can't sign up! Every password thinkable is already in use?!
Very easy to understand and use.
"It failed to assess my symptoms, it's very complicated to use"
Goodapp I was not expecting for your service but u are so wonderful😍 be blessed
"Ada is great at taking every point you give and helping you find possible answers that you don't seem to be finding elsewhere. I wouldn't use it to self diagnose and please don't, but if you are advised to seek professional medical help then I highly recommend listening to it. The app is built well :)"
Good service
Great app for personal symptoms assessment
Just recently re-download Ada and I forgot how much I love it! It's very helpful for me to track my symptoms and have an accurate report to refer to when I talk to my doctor. It's very easy to use and great for when you need some at home remedies for something like a common cold or sinus infection!
Easy to use and accurate enough to get a general sense of what's going on with symptoms.
Very nice Simple to use Provide clear guidance
"Easy to use. The AI asks very relevant questions, offers meaningful possible causes and suggests what I should dicuss with my doctor."
Its very simple and easy to use with simple questions that helped me in the end
It's great app! I always use it when I start feeling bad pain just to check how serious it might be.
"I really like this app. I have a low immune system and half of my body is more swollen than the other and this app gives me more information than some of the doctors I have seen in the past. Ada explains the condition it could be by all of my symptoms. The more symptoms you include the better the app can access the condition you could have, and also allows you to save it as a PDF to print off to ask the doctor to rule the condition out."
"It was pretty fun, And usefull. Considering i only used it today, And it gave me so much information! It also helped me understand my symptoms, And what they mean, And what do about them. I found things that seemed close, And even if i dont have them, The app gave me some ideas of what i may have, And whats close, And what to bring up/Consider to my doctor."
"Highly recommend! Enter all your symptoms and some basic info and Ada will match them with a possible cause. After doing what was recommended by Ada, I felt better the next day. Now on, I'm able to rate the severity of my symptoms and track them. I can also learn more about any condition in their library. Best thing, the app is free and run by doctors! I'm very impressed and will continue to use."
Excellent professional app easy to use and informative 👍
Very easy to use & understand ...
Excellent app. Always very accurate and the information is very helpful.
"I am a complete hypochondriac and if I had it my way, I'd be going to the doctors weekly for every little thing. Ada has given me so much peace of mind when checking symptoms. It's quick and easy to use. It's great that it's all in an app and I don't feel silly asking Google or god forbid another person about embarrassing symptoms."
Easy to use with a super accurate diagnosis.
I'm able to get really helpful information from this app. Thumb up!
Impressive...I use the Ada data to talk with my personal doctor and I am giving tips and prescription to follow. I am doing workouts three times in the week and relaxing my hip. My hip pain is dropping down. Thankz Ada and try implementing new ways of consulting in a fun way and trou personal phones. Like using the phones lights to do check ups. Thankz.
Great app. Easy to use.
It is good and easy to use
"Really good App, simple to use."
Very friendly and very helpful app. Feels like you have your personal doctor at home. Eternally grateful.
It an app simple to use
"I tested this out with a few conditionsalready diagnosed and it was correct each time, it gave me more confidence to use the app to manage symptoms at home or when to see a GP."
Very useful app. I always use Ada to check myself before getting panicked with symptoms. I suggest Ada to everyone
"I really like the way you have analyzed my information, it is the same as I am sick, Please continue to provide services because it helps to know where to start after getting a little information of the problem that is bothering me."
Very informative and pretty accurate information.
"I already knew my diagnosises, I just downloaded this out curiosity to see what it would guess. It guessed accurately for what it did guess (hashimotos, ptsd, depression), but did not pick up on some rarer disorders I have like my auto immune food sensitivity or my DID. So while the app can point you in the right direction, it cannot replace your doctor!"
"Really easy to use, helpful and clear, I love this app"
"Straight forward, easy to use, wonderful graphical presentations"
I asked my Google assistant to name a phone health program it sent me to ada which is a personal health program not what I was looking for.
The app is good and very simple to use but you should at least be suggesting on the medicines to use when a person know his or her problem.
It was right on point.
This one helped me much especially when I am in situations where I could not visit doctor or medical care. This app helped me approximate my diagnosis and provide myself some appropriate care. I would definitely recommend this if you are not willing to go to doctor for small things.
"Amazing app... It's like your personal physician or doctor in the palm of your hands, Always onpoint with their result."
your perfect companion doctor and a complete thorough assessment. And you can use my rating on your website for this purpose only.
Very easy to use... Best health app I know of
Really pleased with results that I put in gave me peace of mind quick and easy to use very helpful app thank you.
Got it all right and detailed questions. Obsessed with its accuracy
Easy to use and effective. 5 outta 5
Love this app it works wonders. I have used it on myself (28yrs old) and my daughter (4yrs old). Wouldn't use any other app. I don't think it needs any kind of improvement.
"easy to use and detailed, absolutely recommendes it."
Good and easy to use for primary diagnosis
Helpful information. Usually I go to the doctor when I feel sick but this app gives me an idea what can be wrong
Good app..easy to use
"Amazing, I love Ada so much! It is a really helpful app, it's so easy to answer the questions and you just need to select your symptoms. Also, it is actually accurate! I'm happy I found about it, also really easy to use! I love Ada, I will continue to use it! ❤"
Good app.. i advice to use!
"I really enjoy every time I use the app even if it's because every time I'm sick. It would be wonderful if the app add more languages, because some explanations explains not misunderstanding things"
"It's such a good app, some of the questions are slightly confusing but you get used to it eventually. It's comforting to know there is an app that I can easily use when I'm unsure of my health or don't feel too well."
"Super helpful on narrowing down ailments. My son had a stomach ache and a swollen lip and I figured it was food allergies, but wasn't sure. Ada asked all the right questions and confirmed my suspicion. It's help me and my family. Great app!"
She was very thorough and asked the necessary questions. But I'm sure she could've asked more questions at the start or the end. Apart from that well I hope in a way she's right but now I fear for my health. All in all good diagnosis. Thanks Ada
A really good app.... It has helped me figure out a lot of things.It doesn't provide help for your mental health problems but it just shows you what is going on with your mental health and how you can improve it. Useful for people who are lost there.
I thought this app was very thorough and would use again to help me know if I should seek medical help or not.
Excellent service off this app
Helpful information 🙂
I love this app. It was right on. I'm glad I found this app. And I wasn't even looking for nothing like this. Thanks 😊 Great Job 👍😁
Easy to.use very helpful
Better than the other symptom checkers. Easy to use and you get results quickly
Very good and information very helpful friendly and caring
GREAT APP.. it's great because it's useful for some reasons like.. for students they can use this to find some medical help even if it's not a real diagnosis.. but still it can help..
"Very clever,easy to use....must be honest and it comes up with different results what it could be."
"interesting app. it seems an AI experience. Might ask about drug use(prescription, over the counter, street, alcohol, smoking) , and lifestyle issues ( sleep, exercise, diet) prior to diagnosis."
"I really like the app. It's easy to use, and doesn't immediately jump to ""you may be dying"" like some other symptom checker apps. I do wish that there was a way to input pre-existing conditions into your profile on the app so that the app could let you know if whatever symptoms you've put into it might be a result of those conditions, or possibly a reason to seek immediate care."
Right on the spot
Easy to use.
Vary easy to use and a useful tool to keep a record of symptoms to inform your doctor about later.
"It takes a little while, be patient. Settings for app needs a tweak to update relevant information."
"Really nice app, very simple to use, (even kind of fun!), and doesn't jump straight to cancer or similar like you would get when googling your symptoms. I use it whenever I feel ill to get an idea of what might be causing it. A few times it hasn't been able to offer any likely suggestions for what I'm experiencing, but for the most part it offers several good suggestions and even gives likelihoods for each condition, which is great if you tend to assume the worst like me."
"It's my first time using this app, will surely use it again and again... Thanks"
"I like the app, but the UI is kinda tedious to use. Also, there should be an option to add conditions you know that you have to your profile. You can browse information about different conditions, but that's all."
The best personal doctor
Simple to use. Easy to understand. Detailed report
great app. easy to use and understand
Unbeliavably helpful always spot on i use it all the time
Guess mine right
Easy to use
A great personal helper
"Ada asks more questions about symptoms than my dr., My Dr. told me a few years back that to never google or use web ms again Today he will ask what Ada had to say about my symptoms and if there were anything else I may have left out !!! LOL"
I use this a lot and it has helped me to diagnose and narrow down potential conditions with my doctors.
Not sure if I explained my symptoms well enough or if just being housebound for so long is making me crazy. However at least it didn't give me a hundred different diseases I could make myself believe I had. I'll use it again.
A little confusing with all the questions so not sure what you are looking for halfway through the information requested.
Allow younger people to use it: 13 / 10+
First time use and came up with same diagnosis as my doctors so far so good
Good at following the symptoms. But sometimes dosen't ask for certain information that may affect your symptoms.
"I often find it hard to properly describe what I'm physically going through, Ada is a service that helps me be more clear and concise. Also, encourages me to contact my GP even if I think it's a minor issue, through the reports given at the end of each assessment."
Love this app was getting proper medication advice and its helpful for all hope so all getting helpfull information with ada app
"Very good app, used it for a condition I already knew I had to test it and it's very accurate. Very helpul and easy to use, I think it's very good for a first assessment at any time. Totally recommend!!!"
"Update: Still amazing! Very helpful and cute. I love the design and I love how helpful and kind Ada is. It's great for peace of mind and information if you can't get to a doctor right away, or can't tell how serious something is."
The app is very helpful. I input all of my information it gave me accurate information concerning my symptoms
Real simple to use app. Good information too.
A very good app. Easy to use and asks enough question to give you several diagnosis and treatment info along with other useful facts about each possible condition that relates to your medical symptoms.
I will be using this app from now on. I give it a 5 + . I was using k heath but was not easy to use as ing finds all the symptoms to help understand whats going on.
It's nit difficult to use i love it
Very accurate assessment if given honest information. Thank you very much.
You could just add an option to say what more symptoms you have and not make a whole test on every one. And i think you could possibly make a deal with doctors and actually the results you get will be an information from a real doctor. When you finish the test the symptoms will be send on a doctors phone and then they could give the diagnosis. Just saying!
"I was searching for an app to read Pulse Oxygen, not sure what this app is meant to do but it doesn't read Pulse Oxygen. With all the questions they ask, I'm assuming this app is just another Chinese Spyware app to track your information."
Very useful & wonderful app to use. It has never gone wrong on my diagnosis
Lots of question but the data recevied and the outcome possiblity seem on point
Very useful and informative app. Easy to use as well.
Their findings are based on research from people with health issues and it's the order of the day. Millions of people have health issues and the information is available anywhere.
GOOD service
"Extremely helpful app. It's concise and clear with a lot of helpful tips to allow you to get the information as accurately as possible. I also like that it has an option to use it for others as well as yourself, allowing you to care for the whole family."
"I tested the app and gave it just one symptom with particular illness in mind, and it guessed it right. It ask all the right questions and makes sure to give you plenty of options for the best, most thorough, results(ヘ･_･)ヘ┳━┳ (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻ᕙ( • ‿ • )ᕗ"
Asked all the right questions that I would never have thought of.
Always been a good insight and puts my mind at rest and when I should genuinely go to a doctor for a second opinion Caught a serious infection and this pin pointed the cause very quickly which in fact was what the app had suggested. Only use as a vauge guideline on suspected conditions obviously. NHS app supported also which is great comfort many thanks
Required to sign up to use it! Just looking for a simple heart rate monitor!
"Good considering its an app. I've used ada for a couple years now and its ok. I don't use it as an actual dr opinion, but just as possibilities"
I thought this won't work so i'd give it ago i have a long term health condition so i entered my nown symptoms and it was right on the money as they say . So i think i'll keep it as it may prove handy one day
Very good service Thank God
"A very good app,, thanks alot, easy to use and educates very well on our health conditions before thinking of visiting health experts."
This was just like talking with a real doctor only Ada asked the right questions and was not impatient. I am very impressed.
"*ALWAYS SEEK PROFESSIONAL ADVICE AND HELP* But this app has been extremely helpful many a time in confirming any medical suspicions when myself or my family is sick. Once ascertaining the most likely issue, we go from there and use home remedies before spending money on a doctor visit that could of been potential avoided."
Great app so far it makes a lot of sense and easy to use and the diagnosis are accurate
I've been using this app for 3 years now. Yet this is the best app of its kind available on playstore. Would really recommend this app. It has a very easy-to-use interface and the results are like 95 percent accurate.
Very easy to use and accurate diagnosis!
Easy to use
"Easy to use app, it help you to narrow down the possibility"
Straight to the point and it easy to use
"It is very easy to use, simple and explains everything you don't understand about the questions."
Easy to use and accurate
The right place to do your health check..
this app is amazing and really accurate.it blows my mind how accurate it is it has kept.me from looking stupid showing up at the doctor's office when it was something I was able to treat at home.and vice versa I have went to the doctor because it was recommended by ada and was happy I listened. a couple times I have had to redo the assessment a couple times I did not click the right option when it gives you all the options to choose from about your possible problems but great app overall
"This app is excellent. Stright facts, no ads, unbiased advice. Simple to use. Much better than Googling symptoms and then having to trawl through unfiltered results."
"I tried to use it but everytime I try to put my email and password or to connect with facebook it says that I don't have good internet conection and my internet it doesn't working, which is not true because I can send messages or watch videos and so on, the internet it does not have a problem. What could possibly be the problem?"
Great symptom assessment app. It is very easy to use and it gives accurate results.
Before I love this app i can use it whenever I want but now even if I try to create new acc i can't. I don't know if there's an update but the thing you change in this app make this sucks.
Extremely efficient and easy to use
"Good app. Gave lots of possible reasons for problem. Also information on it, not just seek medical advice like NHS. Which I might add is pointless as can't get doctors appointment!"
"Nice app, better than other app that is buggy and too many pop-ups. Sleek and simple design, just needed to add more symptoms like ""Pressured or heavy feeling around left/right Pelvic area."""
"So much better than web md. Easy to use, detail oriented, and doesn't spark fear"
Perfect and easy to use
Very easy to use
Very useful app if we have any doubts about our particular health problems this app helps alot I must say it's like our own personal doctor can be visited any time we want to doesn't need to go all the way to the hospital untill it's emergency thanks Ada!
It's the best way to get a check up with going to the doctors office. The assessment is almost always right.
Used it a few times when some new pain arises. I am in my latter 60's so that is a common occurrence. It let's me know if I should be concerned it not... It wouldn't keep me from seeing a doctor if I thought it was warranted but it has gotten me to go sometimes when I hadn't planned to. Very convenient and easy to use.
Very good diagnosis as look as you enter the right information on questions asked
This app is apt and easy to use and understand. Keep the good job out there.
Works great and easy to use. Thanks.
actually pretty helpful & easy to use.
simple to use and possible diagnosis' were adequately explained.
Its xo Easy to use it
Perfect assessment. This app is extremely helpful in my life and is great when my friends need symptom information. Thank you!
"Easy to use,n a great health app"
It's just really easy to use and I feel it worth totally
"Looks great, works great, no ads Edit: It should provide an option for feedback and follow-up corrections after the initial diagnosis"
I think you are right. I'm hoping not. I will seek medical advice too. Thank you.
"Towards a better health system and preliminary online diagnoses. This is what I've been waiting for. Disease classifiers based on huge amounts of data will soon be the norm, I hope so. Many older people dislike this system but I find it very important as a first preliminary classification system where diagnoses can eventually be verified by doctors in person."
Easy to use and very direct cheers
"Very easy to use, and very thorough on questions they ask. Very nice app."
I like the way you can get information that can help you make an informed decision.
Amazing! I use it everytime I have symptoms
Excellent information readily available after answering a few questions....great advice and very informative
Easy to use but its not going to be the most acurite but it still works great
"This app has the best UI and the symptom assessment is also very easy and it analysis is too much accurate Very pleased to use this app ""NOTE - THIS APP ALSO DO NOT HAVE SUCH DISRUPTIVE ADs"" 👌👌👌👌👌"
Easy to use and very helpful regarding possible causes
Brilliant app its very informative and points you in the right direction.
Seems to have a lot of information about possible causes of symptoms. Will be talking to my Dr soon.
"so useful to have, especially if you don't like visiting GPs and want a quick check, easy to use and can then suggest things to your GP too for a quicker diagnosis!"
Great app. Very easy to use.
Great App. Simple to use easy to understand and is spot on!
Very good information
About right
"Diagnosed my dad with Covid. Initially we doubted Ada was right but we took a test to be sure and lo and behold, my entire family had Covid. If it hadn't been for Ada I don't know if we'd have ever figured it out."
Exceptional service
Very easy to use and confirmed what I was thinking the problem I was having was definitely recommend
This app was great. Gives me a better idea about my health when I have a problem and it's easy to use and understand.
"Its acurate,i would use it over and over again"
"Precise and informative, easy to use."
"Straight forward easy to use, non judgemental"
I really like ada coz whenever i am unwell and i tell ada helps me out and when i go to the doctor the doctor also tells me the same thing so i really like ada coz it ia really helpful. Congrads ada. I give u 5 star for ur service...
"I love this app. I use it constantly for so many things, and it's so helpful and nice to get real responses back that aren't frightening and can be real. It has helped me with so much."
Great yall were exactly right
Helpful to provide indications of diseases.
Great service
It's very simply to use and it's exceptional at diagnosing. The only thing you may complain is that there might a lot of questions but you can answer them in less than 5 minutes.
"Maa shaa Allah, very good app, very easy to use and helpful."
"Good app, l got the right answers to my questions and also great tips with solutions on how to go about it. Thanks Ada...👍"
Great app! It logs your symptoms and all details you provide of those symptoms. It is no replacement for medical attention but it helps give you an idea
"Its a good app, but only for certain things... I don't really like how you *have* to log in/sign up, as I download this app and use it, but then not use it for months so I uninstall it and then say a month later Im trying to use it and i need answers quick and it hits u with sign in... I really think it would bennifit from a ""guest user"" button. Its not very in depth when it comes to us telling symptoms. Why cant there be a page where you can say the symptoms we have and not what *you* think."
"Very useful and informative tool quite easily to use, I would recommend this app to everyone."
"Love it! I use it quite often and I like how it usually gives you more than one answer to choose from and I usually figure out the problem which if fortunately usually minor. Such things as tension headache, bursitis, pulled muscle and gas."
This app is good and it simple to use
Good app to use
"So I'm reasonably sure I have EDS, and was curious to see if it would diagnose it based on what symptoms I experience. not only did it ask all the right questions to get the symptoms I missed but feel, but it had no hesitation in diagnosis. a great app.. Edit: I have been diagnosed hEDS. so accurate."
It's cool good service
"Cumbersome and inaccurate. Logs you out automatically, which is really irritating. Poor ""Customer Service."""
Simple and easy to use
"It definitely needs a ""sometimes"" option and a few more personal health questions for assessments but other than than a good app."
"Cool!, It gives us the right causes))"
Wonderful service
A most helpful app! Helps determine peace of mind or symptom urgency. Explains symptoms and possibilities very well while giving a comprehensive overview. App is very easy to use and amazingly accurate. Thank you developers!
Excellent app what got me more intrigued was how they asked the question to get it right.
I went to my spam emails because it said if your email doesn't send them go there but it told me that it looked dangerous and it looks the same as people trying to steal your info. Idk if I should ignore it but I'm not going to proceed because I don't want it taking my information.
"I've used this app several times and have found it to be very useful in helping to point whomever I'm using it for in the right direction ie; take better care of oneself, or go to the Dr.s office and let them know the direction in which to go."
Easy to use nice app and accurance
"Very very good app! To test the app, I entered my symptoms, already knowing which chronic illness I have. ADA immediately fount out I had fibromyalgia! The app seems amazingly reliable. I'll totally keep it on my phone to test it on other chronic illnesses. Plus, the information given on each illness diagnosed is good and complete."
My worry is this: at the end of sign up a confirmation email was sent but in spam box but when I opened it there was a big red warning box saying app. very vulnerable to personal information being subject to non medical professionals. So I uninstalled
Fine app.easy to use.thanks.
"I've been using this app off and on. I know it's designed with intention to ""check in"" regularly, but I find it more useful as a ""should I worry about this"" app. However, now it won't start at all. App ""crashes"" before it's even open. I've cleared all its data, updated it, restarted my tablet, it still won't open anymore."
I love this app. Is easy to use and gives a logical conclusion.
The verification process is so long..and has alot of errors.. am not able to use the app. Still stuck in verification page..👎
"A very good app, concise and easy to use"
"Spot on accuracy! Love it. Only wish it would give more information on the diseases. In most cases, I need to Google for additional information or look on WebMD."
No issues. Great app. And very helpful. I use it a lot. They need one of these for dogs now... that would be amazing.
Easy to use and very helpful
Very good site with relevant useful information
Ada is extremely helpful and provides significant information about symptoms and when to seek medical advice or emergency care.
"Poor app ever seen it's wastage of Data to download this app , You will face problems even to create account I will never ever forever rate more than one star for this app very Stupid"
Receiving more information from this app than going to the actual doctor; Sad days for the health care system. Ada is really good.
Its best.. But just use side image for high Grammatic words when you tap on to simple demonstrate a particular part of body or sample of a particular situation.. Thanks. I love the app💙
"Good questions, accurate information and good options at the end of a diagnosis."
This app ask a lot of personal information and personal health information before you can check symptoms. Its dificult to disclose everything on app which you are not sure where are they taking the information or how are they going to use it. Its no for me. Knowing my name and email are enough let me be free to make search for me and my friends.
"Ada is very helpful if I'm sick and want to find out what i have. The app is very easy to use and user-friendly while also inquiring about your symptoms so that it could assess and provide multiple diagnosis. The charts and graphs helps me understand the percentage of the people receiving that kind of sickness. Also, the questions have an option where users could see what the question really means. An overall great app to people that can't afford check-ups."
"Easy to use,easy to understand"
It's helpful but i prefer if they provide a sample of drugs for medicaton
Very impressive. Confirms my medical teams information.
"Tried and certified app, easy to use with good questionare arrangedly accordingly."
Really great app. Easy to use and helps narrow down what could be the problem. Highly recommend
Very helpful gives insight of symtoms and if you need to see your doctor or not . very easy to use.
"First time, but had useful information."
Good way to get advice. Asks questions and gives information so you can decide what to do next. Very step by step
"For what i had been diognized comparing with the last results, the app is so much good and reality. For every one don't hesitate to use the app"
Very useful information
good start use today but it's amazing 🙏😁 hope will hell me more than this
Why do Have to create an account? You don't have to create an account on the WEB MD App to plug in symptoms and get possible conditions. I just thought this app would be easier than what the WEB MD App was the last time I used it. But I guess not. Just another excuse to get our ad dollars and lure us into micro transactions to get out personal info. Any app like this that requires a account to work is a bad App in my opinion.
Makes me understand my medical issues better. Very thorough and easy to use.
"Easy to use and helpful to check before going to hospital for more check up, gives more options for you to explain your problems"
So good easy to use 🙂🙂
"This app is a life saver! It gives an accurate review of your problem and with solutions, telling you if the problem is serious or not. By any means, DO NOT use the app and only the app, while trying to treat yourself, go seek medical advice too. The app is for you to get in touch with the problem and know more about what is going on. 5/5!"
Very comprehensive and easy to use.
Great app. Diagnosed my sons scarlet fever. Will definitely use as my family are always sick! (3 boys under 5)
Always right! Told me I was pregnant before a positive test. I now have a crazy 3 year old
"This app is amazing! I tend to get anxious about my health a lot, so this app gives me clear indications whether or not I should go to the doctor's or not. Every time I use the app, the answer is either on the nose or very close! Highly would recommend!"
It's good and helpful app for personal health check-up
Easy to use with similar diagnosis as I thought.
Very good quick response easy to go through. Would recommend and use it again .
Great app. Easy to use.
"Somehow the apps is good,but sometimes is not good because it doesn't provide an open space for someone to explain him/her self the way how he/she feels (it's closed questions).."
"This is the best healthcare assistance app! Very simple to use and friendly. So simple a baby can use, so detailed an adult can take ideas before visiting a physician."
I really like this app.very simple to use.and easy to understand.
Easy to use
"The app is helpful, in fact very helpful. Only that simpler words that are easy and commonly understood should be used. Alternatively, provide more pics on questions with a terminology."
Every time i try to verify this up it tells me access denied so i dont know wat it actually wants me to do so i can use it
Very good asks the right questions and you are presenteda very good report of possible outcomes
Right everytime so far
Goods app for pre information about your health about some percentage it's near to the truth but others information it's correctly according to the problem that might been identified ....goods app I give five star..... it's amazing
Quick and easy to use.
This app is incredibly helpful and has lots of additional health information within it which helps the user to evaluate symptoms.
Best symptom checker I have found. Easy to use with quick answers.
This app is awesome! Straight forward and easy to use!
Easy to use. Very insightful and helpful.
It's nice to use ada health
I love to use this App
Nice to use Ada
On point. Great checker. Would use again. Will refer to all my friends. Thanks!
"I already have a diagnosed condition. I was curious about the accuracy of this app. My condition was the first possibility that was suggested. I appreciate how thorough the questioning is. My only suggestion I have is to add an option for ""sometimes"" or ""occasionally"". However, that might not help the algorithm or skew the outcomes. I am impressed with the accuracy and the ease of use."
It is a great up.... Almost all the time it's right
it good nice helpful and simple to use it
Most detailed & helpful. Haven't had any ads & love that it's free. Also like that it ask questions after you enter symptoms & then gives in order possible conditions & the percentage of people who had the same symptoms/condition. It gives treatment options and if it's something to watch for progressing symptoms or if you should seek medical help right away to confirm or if symptoms seem severe the way you entered it. Of course it doesn't replace medical advice but gives a starting point.
This app is useful and simple to use.I suggest to have some option of different languages especially Swahili
"Easy to use, and very informative."
"I'm only giving it 1 star because I spent a whole 1 1/2 hours putting in symptoms and making sure I was getting the right things into this slow app (I can't blame it though bc it's working hard) and it asked me if I wanted to stop the assessment and I said yes because I wanted results but it just threw away all my hard work and now I'm grieving. I thought it was gonna give me results. Please make that part of the app more careful so nobody else has to feel this same pain. - sincerely, me"
Its good to use
Right on the nose!
"This app is the best, very usefull, simple to use"
Try to use more than one Language
"very easy to use, easy to understand and very helpful"
Woooow i don't know what to say but this app help me more than i've thought the information i get here the same as hospital Keep it up Tanzanian
"Asks lots of questions and is very thorough. If I find it asked the right questions and gave an answer that sounded right then it's helpful to know whether something is urgent or not. Edit: the only thing I would change is maybe a feature to turn off the ""are you pregnant"" questions. I'm 22 and have had a hysterectomy. Not a huge fan of being asked if I'm pregnant before even entering any symptoms. 😅"
"thank you so much for creating this app. I was terrified from the results google was giving with my symptoms, and this app put those anxieties to bed. I will never delete this app. The peace of mind I got after putting in my symptoms is about to help me go to bed tonight. I have some mental health issues and I tend to fear for the worst. This app asks all the questions, and then gives you realistic answers and information about each possible reason for the symptoms, in easy terms for you. 10/10"
Full of useful information
Super easy way for me to get an idea of what has been bothering me. Great time saver and easy to use. I love this app!
Ready to use and very helpful
Good service
Very helpful..use Ada app for the improvement of ur health....what are waiting for ? Press and install

"It's cool and teaching, it gives relevant information"
"Very promising app, this could be a very useful future lives saving app. Easy to use and simple to follow and above all is free. Please put a section where someone can donate and support this application. Thank you."
Seemed thorough. I think she was right!
Very intuitive app. Simple to get started without invasive personal ID questions. Like the Ssn and other protected info. We are now protecting with our lives! Great pre-diagnostic tool!
"Very helpful tool in monitoring my health. It is easy to use, contains pertinent explanations and I like that it doesn't turn into a rabbit-hole of unlikely medical conditions to worry about. The design of the app is nice too, clean and minimal, not overloaded with options."
"Personal data transmitted to facebook, maybe even sold to facebook."
Easy to use and one of the best symptom checker apps I have used.
Best app to use when I m worried about my health. Gives me a good idea to seek help or not.
"Very smart application, I suggest people to use it 🙏"
"The App is real working, I learned alot about my health and others. Just your time to use it, it's cheap no expenses."
Straightforward to use. Handy for symptom sorting. Probability of actual condition is useful and reassuring
Says its private and confidential but can't create account unless you tick that you will share all medical data with them lol
Easy to use
Easy to use and very accurate
Good and Easy to Use
This nice app to use as it does investigation as if you are direct to doctor.Thanks
"The best medical app ever, i suggest everyone should use to identify their health problems, thanks"
"As someone who has been told they're a bit of a hypochondriac, this app is EXTREMELY helpful in sorting through symptoms! I had a bunch of medical issues growing up, so this was helpful in figuring out what is ""new"" and what's from an old problem cropping up again! Their symptom list isn't exhaustive, and the questions for the assessments could use some refining, but it's been a super helpful tool nonetheless! It's very refreshing to see something like this available for free use, too!"
Ada told me I had congestive heart failure and was right.
A good and reliable app to provide the informative supplementary disease analysis.
"Great app, easy to use. Means I don't Google and frighten myself!"
"It's very privately helpful, I really enjoyed it when use it, Thank u ADA to you are the life saver"
"Good very easy to use, informative and straightforward"
It's been pretty accurate. It is good at pointing me in the right direction...advice on changes that help.
Best app to use. It even gives you advices during assessment. Highly recommended.
"Hellow, it's simple,more helpful, easy to use on how can we assess our healthy 🙏"
"Very easy to use, and thorough!"
I appreciate the service.. !
I went to my g.i Dr. First then got this app. To compare just for fun and the information given by the app. Listed a cause directly proven by Drs. Tests .I'm very impressed.
I tried it on my current diagnosed conditions and fair play it got every single one right
Very good application and easy to use
The service is ok and well understood.
Excellent app. Always my first to go to when I feel unwell. Very easy to use and informative.
Great app👍 easy to use
It very helpful before you make a move to doctor you use Ada. I love it
Very accurate I tried to confuse it by selecting symptoms for three different conditions. It still got all three right and they were in the list!
Nice App and simple to use and is helpfull i appriciate it.
"It is limited in taking in updated information to revise an ongoing symptoms, or combining symptoms"
This app it easy to use also it help solve my problem easy
Put me in the right direction
Very helpful. Easy to use.
Asked all the right questions about my symptoms and the results were easy to understand. Thank you so much
Its super nice and easy to use
"Good app! The symptom entry is a little limiting, but overall it's quick, easy to use and complete in it's suggestions to take to your doc."
This app is not too bad.ada gave me a list of suggestions it might be and it was correct.this app is so easy to use .I would receive my friends and family to try it.
Assessments are right on !!! Very helpful application
This app try to provide help to people to get better precaution and push people to get medical practitioners for further medical diagnosis
"2018) Very Helpful, easy to use and beneficial Thank so much for designing such a useful app. 2022)-4 years later and still using... it helps me investigate new health issues as they arise. I often research symptoms for family members. It is so informative as we work together for our best health...So Thankful to have this valuable tool."
"very very useful, straightforward questions and straightforward answers with plenty of information only request is to add a ""kind of"" answer when it comes to certain symptoms"
"Really helpful for doing the opposite of Googling symptoms and calming my anxiety when I'm convinced I'm dying forty different ways! It would be helpful to be able to input things already diagnosed with though... Like mental health issues that could cause issues 'just in your head' so to speak, or more serious problems that need to be seen by a doctor or something. It's good to know the background information, I'd assume."
Ada is easy to use and pointed out symptoms that I need to discuss with my doctor.
"Its easy to use, im giving 5 star ."
Really easy to use and makes it easier for me to speak to my GP when it comes to explaining what is wrong in a way they would understand.
"Some assessment questions have to ask how changes of symptoms occurred, some time put the space for personal writing descriptions"
A must use! You will not be disappointed. It's an excellent tool.
Best app for symptoms analysis i recommend it to all as it has so many type of symptoms which same statement but different problems to describe your problem best i feel good to use this app and it is easy to use as well as it is appropriate 😀
"Privacy should be considered, one of the thing that frustrates is that checkbox which requires a person to accept usage of his/her private information"
I haven't read your privacy policy yet but am concerned with personal health information of people you collect regardless the user volunteer to share them
It's an amazing apps and very easy to use.
It won't let me pass the welcome screen with covid information
So good 😊 to use as an advisor
It's nice and trie to take the information to the people
Fantastic easy to use And most of... Helpful.
"I like the service, fantastic"
excellent app. using to use
A very simple to use and direct app....Very good. Keep up.
"Good app but its real power will be unleashed when it starts accepting numeric health data such as haemoglobin levels, ALT, AST, bilirubin, platelet count and other blood/urine test data. Presently, it's a nice proof of concept but not very powerful."
"I came across this by accident, and after seeing details I thought how great to have a symptom checker on hand. My husband is sick and we are always making sure his conditions haven't changed or what he possibly could have. I love this app, super easy to use, and so far we have actually figured out what's wrong with him using ADA as well as it helping our doctors appointments. I highly recommend that every parent or head of household should have this app kn hand . A+++++"
Great and easy app to use.
Surprisingly accurate information!
Good and help full thanks for your service
"Easy to use, free, simply AWESOME Absolute must have app"
"The app is very easy and simple to use for your healthy,I think for my self i will use this app to get more details about my health...I advise everyone to use it for the better healthy!!"
Great app I most often use it to learn or research about the new conditions I find on it by giving it different symptoms randomly I love it
"I have just started to use it, it gave me a really well done report. Sometimes I prefer ada to my doctor. It would be great to have also a feature with medical records: history, drugs, treatments, analysis, checkup's, blood pression, etc."
lol I took this test to see if it'd get my diagnose right it did
"It is good and efficient for health checking,I recommend you to use it if you are concerned with your health"
"It is easy to use.. Only few option for the symptoms suggested. Yes, no and i don't know."
"This a very best healthier app to in use, i recommend it to anyone out there."
"My name is no longer the same as the name of this app, and it won't let me make a new account to change my info. Sad trans hours 🏳️‍🌈 Still good info though, even though I had to unistall. Will probably redownload after I make a new email account. 4/5, accurate diagnistics, easy to use, great app overall. I reccomend it!"
Easy to use. Great explanations of symptoms and possible causes.
"Great and innovative app with extensive features and a wide array of well presented information. I have been using it for years and it has never let me down. I highly recommend this app to replace frantic symptom googling with a more nuanced way to check your symptoms. Cannot replace a doctor, however, it can guide you in the right direction and alert you of any possible emergencies."
The best one app. Tried few but only this one give me true facts about my health problems. You want regret it if you download and use the app. Could be life saver.
Easy to use and to get heath information and advice
"I like it. It seems to be pretty correct on a lot of things. It will NOT and should NOT replace a Doctor but , it's still good to use until you get to a doctor."
The app is awesome. Very easy to use and for sure you can learn a lot about your health from it 👍👍
Very easy to use and helpful it's questions are also clear and direct
"I like this app!It is good to recognize the symptoms of various diseases in a short time ,It is friendly app because after providing correct information then there are 95% of one diseases among of listed diseases will be recognized in you.I have never regretted using this app. !!!!"
Very useful information. Quick and easy thank you
So far so good. Easy to use and the interaction doesnt feel so robotic
Great service
Gives good information to ease ur mind
"I real seen uniq and congress much of,,,for good report i think this is for each other. Ada looking good and very support depending to us but try to use siple vocabularies"
"Complete waste of time, didn't help at all and is just useless, pointless app with no helpful information at all,it just said see your doctor, thanks for nothing"
Asked the right questions .
This is the best app to use for health tips😊
Helpful and very simple to use
"I've barely begun to use this app but within 15 minutes, the time it took me to outline my symptoms and answer supplemental questions, Ada suggested fibromyalgia which it took months and multiple specialists to even begin to explore. I'm excited to use Ada keep track of my symptoms and hopefully it will even help me to finally get a real diagnosis!"
Learned a great deal about myself and cures and treatments in which to persue further. I've used this app for quite some time now and it almost is always right on the money with the possibilities. I'd recommend this app for everyone's phone. But if ever in doubt consult your local ER or make an appointment with your PCP Oh yeah. No ads which is a blessing in and of itself.
Easy to use and informative. Matched the outcomes my doctor has already sent me off for specialist help with. Very good.
"It's very useful than I thought, anyone can use the app it's completely a first aid kit in it."
A lot of questions asked and a lot of information given.
It's nice it gave me a good and well explained information of what was making me sick. It's a simple route to a doctor on your fingers
I can't live without Ada! I use it everyday. Very helpful!! 5 stars hands down.
Need more information related to diagnosis and treatment maybe be API that fetch data from trusted sources like NHS or WebMD would be more informative and helpful.
"It helps to describe the symptoms and find the right way to describe how you feel to a medical professional. For me, it is really a useful tool."
Best personal health service
Aye. I was fully and satisfied with the concern. As i never hesitate to confront at Ada's service
"Very helpful Ada app. Give answer to my simptoms 10 out of ten. All 100%correct. I am happy to use it all the time I have a problem and when go to hospital for check up, everything you have said is correct and confirmed. Very happy indeed 🥰. Very recommended helpful Advice from Ada app."
Easy to use app
Glad to use it. Very informative and helpful
"This is an extremely useful app. I use it all the time. My anxiety tends to make me worry quite a bit about health matters, and my youth (read ""inexperience with health matters"") makes me unsure if I have the flu, food poisoning, or if I'm just hungover. Ada lightens the load on my parents and the local Urgent Care. I think it would be improved if they would also have a ""common sense"" section for young adults (hangovers, food didn't sit well, water and nutrients aren't in coffee and pizza alone)"
"I could say that ada is the most easiest way for personal checkup and not only personal but also for the people you love,it is cheap, time saving and also reliable"
Its overall a very needful app for early evaluations but not always right
Simple and easy to use. Gives ample time to think about symptoms unlike face to face interview with Dr.
Good and easy to use the app.
This has been very helpful & 100% right i found out things on this app before my son was diagnosed with autism thank you so much I've leant so much these last 8 months
"Previously I could use it. Now I can't, it says I don't have an internet connection. Region block?"
"So I LOVE using ada, don't get me wrong. It's so useful. My only issue is ever since the last update, I haven't been able to log back in. I try and all it says is no internet connection please try again. I have tried home wifi, data, wifi at work, still NOTHING. Please help and I'll update my review UPDATE: Omg thanks so much!! I got back in and everything is great!"
Very easy to use and convenient
I thought this app was easier to use than WebMD.
"Very helpfull, easy to use and smart to to understand your feeling"
"Nice app , this is helpful to know many problems that we have and get information what kind of disease that we have it and to control it etc"
Best app and easy to use
Easy to use and not expensive
"The beauty of this app used to be that you could anonymously just give your symptoms and it would be pretty accurate it picked for you. But now you have to create an account which leads to money, which leads to your identity. Not a good app anymore. Use WebMD , it's better"
"Easy to use, and she's really accurate!🤍🤍🤍"
They asked all the right questions.
"I don't normally rate apps, but I like this one, it has information and checks symptoms swiftly and accurately, without scaring unnecessarily with possible diagnosis"
Very exciting to use
Really easy to use with great insights app
Very useful information. Gives alot to understand the diagnosis and possible treatments. Would recommend highly.
A very good app.. Easy to use and very reliable
Very clear and easy to use
Very nice app to use at home
I love this app I use it for my whole family
Easy to use and practical.
"Personally, it hasn't helped me a whole lot. Not because of the app itself but because I havnt had the need to use it , however I can see how it could be useful for others and therefore I will give it 5 stars"
All I wanted to use heart rate monitor. So much questions but couldn't see heart rate monitor
"Why does an account need to be made to be able to use this app? Why do you need a way to find information about me, why can't I just use the app without having to be pressured into making an account? Unfortunately, I know it's to gather the anonymous data I would like to give about my health and make a profile about myself while selling it."
Pretty accurate assessment. It's pretty beneficial for those that don't like to go see a doctor unless they're dying. Lol. I have found this app very useful and will continue to use it in the future as a second opinion before deciding whether I should voice my concern to a professional. Also helps to ease your mind if you have the tendacy to overthink your own possible diagnosis. Thanks
"Ada is really helpful and accurate! Ada is really easy to use, as it has easy questions to answer. I love using it when at worry for my health!"
"This is my most favourite app I get right diagnosis, the creator is a genius thank you ... even my doc didn't focus on my symptoms like this app"
Straight forward and easy to use. The only improvement it needs is more specific questions in regards to symptoms. Thank You!!
Systematic and intelligent questions. Has good report analysis and gives more additional information. To me the program is cool.
"It's good,easy to use and understandable"
Quick and easy to use
Good information
"Wow! This is amazing and helpful I like it so much! Easy to use and very accurate! Good luck, thank you so much!"
"I love this app, I wasn't sure at first if this was going to be helpful because the symptoms I was having were mental health and not physical health but Ada does it all. It has been so helpful for giving me an idea of what might be going on so that I can bring it up to my psychiatrist. I have been so confused about what's been happening to me and Ada suggested BPD and after searching it up it definitely feels right and my psychiatrist has agreed that it definitely could be the case. TYSM ada :))"
Extremely easy to use. Very accurate
Sound information
It's so good & easy to use
"Very easy to use, with very fast information, advice and diagnostics."

"Extremely easy to use app, has a lot of information and asks some really good questions for diagnosis. A+ from me"
"Very good. Gives a range of possible diagnoses and recommends treatment, saving many trips to the doctor. Clear and easy to understand and use, includes photos and further explanations to help people describe their symptoms."
95% of the time right. It gives me a clear statement of what might be wrong. I can go to the doctor or stay home based on how serious it is.
"Ada is great.It makes specifying symtoms so easy, and it made me aware of things I didn't even know were there!And it asks all the relevant questions with further elaborations, plus it's very simple to use, I love it!"
"As someone with anxiety that can be triggered by "" what's wrong with my body"", googling symptoms can lead to possible spiralling. This App asks the right questions and gives the probability of the diagnosis which is so helpful."
Helps check if the symptoms are something you should be worried about and gives large amounts of useful information about possible problems.
"Right on point, very Accurate"
Easy to use and offers quick report with possible diagnosis for you to follow up with your doctor if you need to.
A very good application to know whats wrong with you and easy to use
Awesome app. Has been right more than once. It's like having a pocket doctor. Deffs worth a download!
very informative app. Reliable information.
Very accurate and it depends on the data you provide about your health. The much you provide the accurate results will be.
"It's simple, lite, easy to use, and very helpful."
"Excellent service , really helpful when you can not going to GP in midnight ! Thanks to all developers"
"Since switching to Pixel 3a the app is nonfunctional. When I try to login, it gives me the privacy consent again, then takes to a plain white screen"
"I use a Pixel 3 XL, and like many others have stated I too get a white screen after accepting the terms and conditions. How am I supposed to know I don't have a chronic illness? Yeah, Google is an option, and so is going to the doctor, but I live in the middle of no where! Ada team, please fix this."
"This app is literally impossible to use, every single time I click on something It bugs, its lagging and It keeps asking me to confirm the same thing over and over again."
good to use
Best advice and gives you right answers.... Thank you
GREAT APP! The reports are always spot on and it gives so much more information. 10/10 recommend
"What a fantastic app. Your own personal triage, right there in your pocket, when you need it. Brilliant. Must admit, haven't delved into using any paid services as of yet but that's not to say I never will."
"Very good assessments with facts and information to back up the diagnoses. Great at getting to the source of the problem, way more helpful than google."
"Good, very informative and helpful. Easy to use."
"Since I updated this app, I couldn't sign in my account. I've been using this app from 2017 and there were some my health track which almost accurate with diagnosed by my doctor, but again.. I cannot use this. I tried to create new account, but again, this app said ""cannot verify your account.."". This is bad."
Hello? Why can I now not get into this app I sent my details now I cant even get my verification code gaaa and I waisted a whole .something amount of data heh baba datas not cheap 🤦‍♀️ you'll dont play games like that
I really love using this app. Very useful and the info provided really makes sense and has great relevance based on the data you've entered. I highly recommend this app to anyone.
"The assessments that have been done, have been right so far."
Great app! Really helps to get an idea about your symptoms and shows information clearly.
Simple and easy too use!
"ada gave me easily understood information, as where WebMD didn't. I will be using ada for any medical questions that I have in the future. Very helpful"
"I really like this app and really love the fact that you can also track your symptoms as well as ""diagnose"". The fact that ada uses actual information and matches symptoms of yours with others' to let you know what is most likely your issue is surprisingly calming. Much different than just googling and having the most horrible possibilities coming up."
"Insightful, this app helps me whenever i am under the weather, it could use a couple features about seasonal/local diseases that are going around but it thoroughly checks your symptoms and tells you what it could be, along with a rating of how severe it could be, treatable at home, medical advice needed or go to the emergency room. It is nice to have a better understanding of what i could be coming down with and what actions i can take."
This app is amazing. although it's not a real doctor diagnosis but it always gets my symptoms right. very good job. well developed app.
This app is great! It's easy to use and always makes my feel better. I'm a little bit of a hypochondriac and seeing that I'm not going to die is great.
Removed the app after finding out that it shares PRIVATE HEALTH DATA with THIRD PARTIES.
Shared data with third parties like Facebook and other trackers. There is no excuse for such behaviour. Especially for an app that process private health related data.
Uninstalling this ASAP after hearing that sensitive health data have been sent to this parties.
Great app. Easy to use. Good Advice...
It's the best it has nailed the right infections bang on
I like this app because it takes the time and asks all the right questions.
👌 Very helpful. I find it to be quite spot on and I use it regularly. I would definatley recommend. It's easy to use and just a helpful and well rounded platform in a whole
"Good. You can use it on yourself and on others, as you can create different profiles. An offline mode would be nice. Developers, please keep up the good work!"
"Very good, it predicts the actual diesease in me by getting 60 plus % information from me, thank you for making this app"
Very helpful information
Very useful app. A perfect use of information system.
I feel the assessment was very good. Seemed like all the right questions were ask and the answer was easy to understand.
It's absolutely amazing and easy to use.. Just explain and get your result accurately
Great app needed to fines some symptom and hopfuly ive been put in the right direction

Great app... Good to use
Super easy to use and has repeatedly given the correct diagnosis which have then been confirmed by doctors each time

"Very helpful and has an easy to use, clean UI"

"Awesome app, could use with more accurate ""how long has this been affecting you as in hourly options like 1 hour, 2 Hours, 5 Hours etc Now if you'll excuse me I'll go tend to my severe migraine that I got from my teacher"
"great ap, accurate, helpful, feels compassionate and safe, hard to use if have small screen or if using portrait view on my samsung galaxy s7 edge"
Professional and Personal Health Advisor
"This app asks thorough questions, and puts u on the right track to go and seek medical attention if needed."
Very very very great app always gives me the right report. I would rate this 20 star and more if possible. Friendly interface. I pray it keeps getting better and better.
Am happy to use this app
Ada is easy to use and informative. When I have something happening that I'm not sure about I can enter my symptoms and get a better idea of what is happening.
"Easy to use, very helpful."
Very easy and helpful to understand With information about things i didnt even know solid 5 outta 5 rating well done
Best diagnostic app & very easy to use.
I love it. It's very simple to use. Very helpful. Not a lot of bad very direct.
"It was wonderful,I already feel like I have a personal doctor"
"It looks accurate, do not hesitate to use it, at least for the mild conditions, Thank you"
Its a awesome App to use and really easy to understand.i love it.
This app is a really good app because of how easy it is to use
The service is very helpful especially if someone is needing fast assessment of what is disturbing normal body systems
I found it very use full
"The service is amazing, and the outcome is precise."
Very easy to use app
I find this app better than the 111 service as when i ring them no matter what i have wrong they will insist on calling an ambulance.
"Then more you provide info, the better the report."
"As someone who is recovering from tuberculosis, I tried this app in order to see whether the symptoms chosen will provide similar results as per the doctor's diagnosis, and the results are accurate. Excellent app!"
Easy app to use and very helpful
The use of this app is powerful it can tell you about what is troubling you before you meet or consult a doctor
"Honestly, you should get this on your phone. You might not be sick or have any symptoms right now, but when you eventually do, it can help a lot. It'll give you a report of what kind of infections/diseases/whatever for possible diagnosis. It can greatly help you when it's needed in some time."
This app is exceptionally best for self diagnosis. Just provide the correct symptoms and it will show the possible diseases. This app gave the exact diagnosis every time.. kudos to the dev😘
They provide best assistance..perfectly true
Great app..easy to use
"Thorough screening process, which if answered honestly, will provide good indicators of the potential issue(s). Great app, easy to follow."
"Amazing, seems to get it right very often! Would recommend as a first port of call for non serious issues but would never see it as a replacement for a visit to the GP!"
This is great I can and will use this app for other medical questions
Easy to use. Seems to have a wide range of symptoms you can use to define your issues
Amazing app you better use it its really helpful
App is cool You can use it
One of the best app that everyone must have.. It is way better than worrying of personal medical conditions..... It may suggest possible accelerators to what you are goin throug. However i suggest they should offer simple prescription platform within app for people medically diagnised with several health......
I love this app so much as i use to consult first here before visiting doctor ..it is comfortable to entry to doctor room after consult here
"Great first use, recommended 10/10."
The app is self explained and easy to use.
Everytime ada is used she always seems to know me at a personal level. AND SHE HAD been right on track . I feel so comfortable everytime I use ada
"May not always be a right, but it does get pretty close. I love the app."
User friendly and the use of simple words and explicit explanation of a particular ailment It's good
"It is a good and help App, I would like to use every time before going to hospital and help others.It is very useful.... congrats"
Wont let me sign up to use the app. It gets to the subscription request where i give them my email but then wont let me go any further to complete sign up. So now I have spam emails and no access to the app. 😑
Good tool for getting information about your body getting older can be somewhat stressful because things start changing this app gives you more information in order to hopefully identify potential changes going on with your body.
"Thanks for being so usefull i had a headache for 4 days until i hopelessly tried checking on ada .. i took ibuprofen as mentioned in treatment and the headache vanished in less than half an hour, thanks for the hard work and the helpful organized information."
Why do I have to sign in everytime I want to use the app
Great app. Very easy to use but it's real keen on telling you you have the dreaded lurgy ( c word) I can see how this app would bring a lot of anxiety with those who are sensitive to their health and self diagnosing it.
easy to use
This app is an awesome way to find out what may be wrong with you judging from your medical symptoms It is so easy to use and is a great help when you can't reach a doctor sooner
Great App. easy to use very helpful 5★
Nice to use as your little mobile doctor. Mostly accurate.
I can't sign up to use the app
Very thorough and easy to use
"Easy to use, thorough and clear"
This app is very great and simple to use
"Really good app, easy to use, and provided additional info for my symptoms spot on with the diagnosis..."
"I love this app, I use it to get an idea of what's wrong. I would like if there were a ""sometimes"" option for questions that are just yes/no/idk and letting us pick multiple options when it asks a clarifying question (ex. dizziness, asks what the dizziness feels like but you want to choose multiple answers because it feels like a mix of a more than one)"
Has gotten my diagnosis right 90 percent of the time best app I've ever used
"I 'tested' Ada on 2 current and 3 previous and diverse conditions and it was exactly what my GP and Consultants diagnosed. Although I did know the questions and answers in advance, but without examination or visual clues, it is impressive. The injured limb questions are pretty alarming if you don't have a strong stomach. I think this is better than NHS 111 service, for non urgent but worrying matters. You get a report of most likely causes within 1 minute of submitting your answers."
You won't use the app all the time. But it's always there for you
It was great and I got the information I needed.
Found it quite easy to use and you can get a meaning or description of something you may not be certain about which is very helpful
"It is perfect, it is so helpful and orginised. It is full of information and for me this app has nothing that needs to be imptoved."
It asks pretty personal questions and doesnt tell you who you could talk to other than parents and friends but overall a good app.
First time to use it but sounds great! Shall give 5 star after close confirmation
"Easy to use, helpful and can be reassuring."
"Good initial advice on general health, I use it to see if my symptoms are serious enough to go seek further medical advice."
"its cold and flu season in UK right now and i have started feeling symptoms and used ada, it said i have a cold and i am now resting and getting better. i love tracking my symptoms. every one at ada are amazing"
Ada provides in depth information related to symptoms and health concerns. Very helpful.
Very easy to use and accurate
Amazing and mostly accurate! Easy to use and thorough!
My personal doctor every time every where.😘😘
Sharing personal data is not cool
"Just waste of time... It can't review any article regarding health and also, it only guess our disease..."
Ada is really a great application... It mostly tells the right thing that has happened .... I really appreciate the work of its developer...!!
"It was right, my dad did have TB. Nice app 😁"
Gives a thorough medical explaination and statistical data. Very helpful for the average person
A good and useful apps for self information. Thanks.
"Gave good, quick information. Confirmed my thinking"
Excellent service thanks
Its awsome but... u have to be 16 or older to use it
It was straight to the point and gave me the exact answer I was looking for since I had already known my medical issue . I do wish the all would make suggestions or link you to perhaps an article or something on how to cope with and help with your issue .
awesome! best app one can use!
I beautifully designed app that's easy to use and surprisingly accurate. As a healthcare professional I was able to see the direction the questions were leading me and they were quite close to the assessment questions I was trained to use. All in all I'm very impressed.
"Very true,i believe the information will greatly help me to get well.God bless you for all you are doing and continue"
Was impressed! Will use it again.
Very helpful information.
"Amazing, helpful, easy to use app!"
I love this app My personal doctor
"Right now i have no suggestions, I am amazed with the thoroughness and accuracy of the apps diagnosis. At first the questions seemed bothersome and overkill but after getting the possible causes list and associated info and recommendations it was well worth the time to answer each one! Keep it updated and thorough and I'd give it 10 stars if it was available rating! God bless"
Ada is so easy to use. Useful as a way to be aware of symptoms which we may not have thought of reporting to the doc.
It pinned down my diagnosis correctly. I like how it claims that its report is not a medical diagnosis but is just some extra information. That disclaimer is very important.
"It is super cool! Most of the people tend to solve issues just by using an app in their phone, but what I like to Ada is that it tells you that the symptoms described by you can fit for the issues that are told to you; but it is necessary to see a doctor for better results! First day of use and Love this app!"
Approximate estimation use for all diseases
It is nice app it is very useful to know about the disease on our basic information on symptoms
"Great app. Seems to be professional. I'd like to be able to tell Ada about my professionally diagnosed conditions though, it would make it a lot easier to use."
Love it so much... It's like a personal doctor😍😍
Right on target with the symptoms I was looking at on google.
"I read two other reviews of this app before installing it. One was positive, the other negative. Both reviews mentioned answering a lot of questions before getting their diagnosis. The app can only help you if you work with it. I took several minutes trying to understand and answer each question. I think I was asked maybe 10-15 questions. Perhaps that's because I had fewer symptoms to assess. However, I believe if you want a tool to work well, one must understand how to use that tool well."
"Tried this when I had a sore throat, said I had Acute Pharyngitis(bacterial infection in the throat). Went to the doctor the next day for a physical inspection and they said exactly the same. Cant say anything bad about it, it asks all the right questions and is easy enough to understand. Gives accurate information about different ailments. Nice."
It's good but it should also provide the medicine guide for making feel good to the Patiant and it is slow I think we should make it fast in asking questions and giving advices
It's very nice app and it has very useful information
Its a good app with a lot of information..
"This app is now my personal doctor, I love it"
Very useful in your daily life like your personal health advisor.
very good app....its very helpful for all the people ... I would like to suggest all the people yo use this app so that you can put your health problem here and get answer what us happening to you ... Thanks ....
simply its a great app for evryone but its better if ada can provide some tips after knowing the health conditions simple and easy to use love this aap thankyou ada.
Awesome app for your personal healthcare..Ada i love 3000💞💞
this was very helpful to me I like this app .it's easy to use and understand .it also help me solve my medical problem.
"This is quite very fantastic, it provide nessesary knowledge"
The app has been so helpful. I now understand the thinking of my doctor. The interface allows for a painstaking assessment of the patient. I use it to help solve my family health riddles.
It's just amazing... A Doctor right on my palm! 👏 And I love how it still emphasizes on seeing a Doctor.
Easy to use and very understandable.
It is an OK experience. I just checked to see if the diagnosis I had from doctor was right. It tallied. So I guess for me it's OK.
"I never stop to review an app. Ever. But this app has been something special. It's thorough, its incredibly easy and has helped pinpointing issues with myself and a few loved ones for a year or so now. It doesnt claim to diagnose ANYTHING, however its been the best tool to know where to start when something wasn't feeling or looking quite right. Thank you so much for this thoughtful and beautiful tool."
Its easy to use and helped me alot
Best app ever!!! If I dunno what I feel sometimes. I use this app & its impressive how accurate the result are. 😘
Useful app we use in home for free charge. Improve ai. For detac
"Very helpful and easy to use. I'd like to be able to tell her about chronic illnesses though. I have chronic bronchitis and heart problems due to birth defects, and I know the difference between those symptoms and when new symptoms arise. I've used this app multiple times, checked back with my mother and god mother (both doctors), and they've given me similar diagnoses, so I know the app is very trustworthy. I only recommend adding a chronic illness feature, to get a more accurate report."
The best motivated app for health issues that diagnosis and suggest treatment primarily within minutes. If one is having any health issues please juat try it out. I am sure you won't be disappoint. Great help for personal health care issues indeed. Thanks ada.
The best app guiding about your healthcare! I really enjoy the information it gives...
Honestly this is the best app i have on my phone. It really helps me figure out what's going on in my body. I cannot recommend this enough and I know that sounds typical. Also this app handles questions for mental health so well! It gives me a lot of reassurance and i like that they ask what happened after the assignment to better the information for the future.
It's fast and easy to use
"Ada is just a great app, easy to use and it's almost never wrong, be sure to use the app well and not misdiagnose yourself 😉😉"
Ada is a wonderful that helps diagnose problems both in physical and mental. I'm glad i installed this application so i can ask ada about my illnesses as well as my friend's illnesses. The application is easy to use and very user friendly
Absolutely incredible. Took 5 minutes to provide a report that took my doctor more than 6 years to diagnose.
Great app. Gives me possible answers and when I ask the doctor it's almost always right
"An amazing and easy to use app, although it's not to be replaced by a professional diagnosis it's still a great tool to have specially when you're insecure about some minor symptome"
Very helpful in giving options that illness resembled. Each system review gave more detailed information so you could decide what seemed more accurate to your symptoms.
Very imp information all da pipl should join dis app
"I did not open the app as you have to create an account and that means more information can be harvested about you, not only your personal details but also now any medical issues or problems you may have. There are other apps that don't require your personal information that do the same job."
"This is my first time, and i must say your platform is a good one. God continue to bless and provide for you all you need to perfect this good work he is using you to do."
This app is good for health related problems... U get a professional report but one thing they could provide is with the proper treatment .. Otherwise I would have rated this app a five star ⭐
This app helps one determine the urgentcy of seeking medical help. It also provides much information related to symptoms and different alements that can be discussed with ones health care provider.
So far i have had 3 things I have concerns about anf it got them all right.
Use it often to get an ideo of whats going on when i am sick. Questions are on point but sometimes a little hard to understand but there is an option that solves this
"This program is good and helps in more times, but I hope that the addition of Arabic to the program in order to facilitate the user's use"
thank you.. this information was very helpful
Very imfomitive. Easy to use
Very insightful and informative. I will forever use this app as well as get professional medical help wherever it is needed.
Not of any use... Sick app
Giving the truth information
Totally fake aaps not getting correct information about diseases
"I am very happy to have my personal doctor online. This is so good, keep it up guys"
Found out certain helpful to know symptoms. No ads/irrelevant information in between. Minimal interactions. Would love to contribute myself to the development of this app! :)
"Useful, easy to use"
Very best app. Everyone must have this app in his cell. It is easy too use. Suggestions for treatment are quite reasonable.
Very good and easy to use.
It's great...i am using Ada for more than 6 months now...never had such a type of health guide before...I loved it..it's just that after use...u might get a better idea of loving it..this is what i needed and so i got..it..thank you Ada.
good information
not easy to use
Don't want to identify myself to use this app. Email is required. Good bye.
"It's says the app is for EVERYONE, and you have to check if your 16 and older?!?!? This dumb app has to change, I am 13 and it doesn't allow you to use it if your under 16, and it's saying that is for everyone, which means anyone can use it. HORRIBLE AND DISAAPOINTING, TOO."
Awesome app. I use it everytime I am sick or my family is sick
Very helpful and easy to use
It's like a personal nurse for you.
Handy reference tool with immediate information! I've used it a few times now and after visiting a doctor it is very accurate.

Its like i had my own personal doctor besides me
Easy to use and interactive

Nice app! Very easy and fast to use. Succinct questions.
Helpful and easy to use
"It is very accurate and really thorough throughout the whole process. It is well planned out, gives lots of helpful information around your symptoms. This app has opened up a door to help with sickness that minimises doctors visits, which is awesome especially for someone who is sick often."
"Without wasting anytime, first and foremost download this. In India, people spend weeks to just know about their status medically. And here, this app comes with a solution. About half of check up is done here and we get to know whats the problem. The advantage of using this: 1. It doesn't prescribe any medicine - which means it will guide you towards your doctor with a contented information, 2. It clarifies the problem multidimensionality. The best ever med-app. Try and you'll never leave this."
"Overall very good user experience, simple keen and easy to use"
Very beautiful app. Genuine information.
True information provided by this app.
"Know your symptoms well and get the most up to date information and result. It's an amazing App, always pointing thru."
Much Appreciated Very good to use
Easy to use. Also helps to understand the question your are given. Friendly UI. It would be nice if it has a dark mode.( Only Optional I can use it without dark mode with no problem ) Without dark mode this app has everything I want for my first use and experience. I also love how it asks so many questions and it makes me happy to answer it😊
"Love the app,very helpful and gives plenty of information. Would recommend"
Really nice app I got all information easily about my health
My personal doctor advice.....that what i feel. Amazing app. Well done
It gives me all relevant and useful information to cure the symtoms one is having.
Ada app is first running help when everything is not right about our health. The advice is so perfect and gives a way forward on what to do about our symptoms. I wish everyone had this app.
Useful tool to stay healthy and to seek the right treatment for your health condition.
This is actually amazing she has just helped my best friend and now my friend is able to have fun I love this app you should definitely use it
Best personal health check-up
"Easy to use and helpful, but remember that it is only an app and cannot replace a doctor"
"Best health evaluation app I've ever used, accurate and easy to use."
Such a great app so easy to use.
"Easy and systematics enough to keep collecting our data correctly and precise. They have a lot of information, even when they give some explanation on uncommon words they wrote. They helps both about physicall and mental health. Excellent!"
Easy to use and very helpful
Very Useful . Dear Citizens of Earth use this app and salute to our ada health guiders Thank you very much ada
Its really good helps me understand what my problem is and its just like doctor to me Its amazing.i just used it right now but i am so impressed
Thanks for the information
"Very helpful, 100% right answer"
It is really helpful. Whenever me or any of my family members get cold or any symptoms I recommend them this app and they use it. And I also recommend you people to try this app. Thank you.
Great app for us (world) healing the world. I would love if app would provide us solution too.
It is the BEST! you guys should use this app!💯
"Good aspects of this app: - Quick assessments; generally take less than 5 minutes to complete - Clear questions supported by additional context and/or images - Allows you to track symptoms for any ongoing conditions - Provides a wealth of information on possible conditions, including symptoms, risks and preventative strategies - No interrupting adverts Overall a very useful app"
I used it a couple of times and it's pretty accurate. Very detailed questionnaire. Of course you can't determine the final diagnostic based only on Ada app without going to a doctor but it gives you an idea of what could it be. Overall is useful and easy to use. I recommend it!
99.99 accurate information and possible diagnosis they doing great service to human mankind.
"First time use. Satisfactory compared to other apps, which follow up on health status a day or so later."
"A really nice app!, extremely simple to use. Gives an accurate diagnosis based on the simptoms inputed."
Easy to use and very informative
Very easy use app.
"I guess it's as good as it could be. But it does not get the right diagnosis all the time obviously. You still need to go to the doctor. And if you have health anxiety, this app is not for you!"
Information obtained was helpful.
Very informative and easy to use
"This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have."
Ada your very helpful because your diagnosis is true highly recommended to everyone to use Ada in everyday's life.
"Good concept. Needs more data though, I can almost never find the actual cause of my sickness or pain."
A very good apps.its showing almost everything right
Very useful app. Had it a while back but it had thing that we're to be desired. Tried it again and they improved the service. Great app for my purposes.
A very vital app for helping people at least get useful factual information from some particular observable patient symptoms.keep up
So easy to use.
Really great aap but need more update like covid-19 related symptoms information.
Great information very good helped me
Very helpful and easy to use and understand. Always my first stop for health problems. Love this app!
Doesn't give advice like it is a doctor. It *suggests* the medical ailments possible and asks a lot of questions before that. Better that you use it and then go to a doctor so you know if he's cheating you. Recommended 💯
I use Ada to know all the basic information about my health before i see my doctor...
Excellent app easy to use
Excellent app. Very easy to use and provides good information
I was pretty impressed with the ability to give a reasonable diagnosis with the information I gave them.
Ada has been right every time so far.
"Good app for Disease identification and more advisable for Identified Disease. For example: During the 13/09/2020 I tried to undergo a Test Question for the Symptom being feeling into my Left side of Chest for more than Seven years and they described to have a Blood Pressure. Also advised to check for Doctor for more measurent and Treatment,Out of that they advised to undergo daily exercise, Escaping the behaviour of Alcoholing, Reducing eating undiet food. Thnx for the service and Hospitality"
Easy to use
This app has very good tracking for many diseases and I loved it a lot. It has good UI and its report are so relatable. Must use.
"I wish there was a way to save what you had been treated for, meds taken etc. then it could better help decide what was going on. I have a couple diagnosis that your program does not recognize so it makes it harder to answer your questions. this app has been right on 3 out of 5 major times I needed guidance. the other 2 were close after seeing my doc. I have tried many times to leave a comment like you asked...with no response that I ever found. maybe someone will read this."
"verry nice how come doctors dont use apps like this first then pursue further investigations ? they should, they can always give diferent diagnosis if they dont like your, how do i tell the dr. they suck, they have given no answers to me yet! you have, thank you ADA, sincerely Jennifer Schooley"
Just i have place the symptoms and the queries are matching like what we had discussed with physical doctor. Really this helpfull 90% to know the health problem. Good to use this app.
"Simple, easy-to-use and interactive. Very informative, definitely recommend."
"Amazing. Very accurate results, fully free. Amazing and very easy to use."
Easy to use and brilliant making
It's like having a medical personnel right by your side whenever you need some advise on how to address your symptoms. Highly recommended 👍
Amazing app. I really enjoy it and have already used it a few times. It's super smooth and easy to use. Love it!
"Not an accurate medical report, but you could use the assesment as reference/guide, especially when you dont really feel like going to hospital and see doctor in this corona pandemic"
"Very good, thorough and accurate information given by the app."
I rated this app as 5 star. Because of it's personal desigh and the correctness that loooks like following a medical book. Love this app.
"This thing is seriously an anxiety saver from Google searches. For me, it has so far been 100% accurate (after seeing a professional medical professional) I use for myself and in several friends (allows geust option) but it's cover gingivitis, sprained ankle, mono, yeast infection, hay fever. As someone and friends with allergies, it's been a comfort knowing it's not always covid. This is not a medical garentee but it's the free, instant, next best thing."
"It's very helpful, doesn't take long, and it's easy to use. I'm definately 
keeping this app!"
"Very easy to use, like the way it adapts to you"
Very easy to use and very helpful information
This is the most amazing app. Ada is like a doctor. Ada told me whole information what happend to me. What are the symptoms and many more. During this pandemic Ada help me a lot. I salute you for making Ada. Thankyou very much....
I love u ada my health care app. He is like my personal doctor to me. I always question him when i have any health condition and dont often go to doctor for silly small reason. $ saving app. I love this.
"If same word of symptom is not in its data base , it don't show any suggestion . If proper word is not given as input , show some suggestions ."
"Great, always has the right questions, and we are able to identify what the problem is and when doctors are needed."
Easy to use. Questions are simple to understand and answer.
"Obviously, consultation to doctors guarantees better prescription, but this app do its job. And easy to use."
Amazing app. It serves its purpose effectively
It's very easy to use ... You just have to answer few simple question and it's done ...
Very helpful. Will use again.
"Good app and perfect one ,, among many medical apps, this is the best one I recommend people to use this for better of their healthies.. Loved it"
Brilliant app to stop you googling every symptom and panicking and thinking the worst. Uses deductive reasoning and logic which is hard when someone is ill. Takes five minutes to use and doesn't waste your doctor's or your time if symptoms aren't serious.
"After making me register and verifying my email, it is asking for and getting my consent to participate in medical research, Ada just stalls and does not proceed to the actual core functionality. No explanation is given what is the problem and I cannot withdraw my registration. Very unhappy about this."
"I don't typically leave a review unless I think a product it subpar (not the case here!) or superior. This app is easy to use with clear results. And unlike other symptom checkers, it doesn't always diagnose impending doom. 11/10 would recommend."
The best app ever best feedback best service I love it❤️ and I will recommend it to my friends and family thank you so much for your services
"I love this App and It's found all my problems perfectly, also it's a very good assistant to know about your minor problems, rather than going to a doctor for minor fever or cold, Ada would provide good suggestions and saves money for sure 😃😁"
Brilliant App .. Easy to use and very helpful information given. After seeking medical advise i can honestly say Ada's summaries have always been correct.
Easy use and clarity of input
"Excellent app, very easy to navigate. Lots of very informative information and help, would highly recommend"
I am impressed. 5 stars .ez to use . just one issue and it may be my fault. I did not see A return to previous question. Or ability to change a wrong answer..
Doesn't always ask the right questions or take into account your description of symptoms.
It works great with a lot of information.
I have use it for a year or so now and it's honestly been really helpful. It's pretty accurate and reasuring. 200 out of 100 would recommend
Very useful and easy to use.
This is really great. It's best to talk and recive information about one's problem. Really really helpful.
"Great concept. I like that you're not trying to replace a medical diagnosis, but offering a place where users can get access to information, a view of possible causes and an indication of typical treatment. Knowledge is power."
So far love it! Just got past where u put ur symptoms in and their questioning was spot on. Like they knew me. I've put off seeing the Dr so my health went down hill fast. I've been trying to think of how to explain everything to my Dr bc I never word things right had trouble explaining everything. U all took the words right out of my mouth so thank you so much!
It's like personal doctor having in your pocket. Very useful app.
"Great app that's easy to navigate. Wish there was a way to input the degree of different symptoms so the diagnosis can be all the more accurate. But otherwise, I use it quite often for minor health issues"
Everything is amazing no doubts. I promise you to use this app. Suppperrr love it!!!
Easy to use and very much helpful in all cases
Easy to use. Thorough with assessment questions.
Every diagnosis has been right and it was also helpful to have an overview over my symptoms
So far so good. Gives great information
Very easy to use.
"Hi. I really love ADA, its great. I suggest you add a 360 movable avatar so we can poing the part of our body that is affected. It will help us and you give specific analysis. You can make this a + for your premium service or just make it free for the community. I dont need credits for this recommendation, but it will be nice if you offer it."
It is good reporting.. and give useful medical information
Ada 's prediction is always right in my experience Thanks
Very accurate information...very helpful
Fantastic App for fast information about one's sickness
My son got me this app and I use it all the time.
Absolutely spot on with diagnostic information. Interesting and informative app. Very useful.
"EDIT: yes, the developer can use this for marketing.This app literally saved my mother's life. She had severe back pain for almost a day, and the app said she may have an atrial tear (among other similar diagnoses). Bottom line is that I knew it was serious. It got her to finally go to the hospital despite being very fatigued. Turns out she was having a mild heart attack! The doctors said that if she had waited much longer, the damage could have been much worse or even fatal."
"Great symptom checker. You will create a profile with your specific information, and then it will walk you through a symptoms checklist, in which at the end you will receive a probable ""diagnosis"". A useful app, especially in these times."
Great app...easy to use. Very helpful
State of the art clinical diagnosis Ada makes me feel like am missing with my personal doctor because every step is simple precise and accurate
"Good app but sometimes dosent ask ýou the right questions, there should be a way for you to ask certain questions"
Guess was nearly right about one of the symptoms but correct about the others.
"Great app, easy to use and so handy. Sometimes I have symptoms and need to at least get an idea of what may be wrong. It's nice to finally have an app that will at least give me a list of what could possibly be going on. I love this app at my finger tips 24/7."
"I am simply AMAZED with this app!! I put in my symptoms, answered a few questions and the ""suspected diagnosis"" was spot on with my physician. I was sceptical, but now I will use this app anytime I am having health issues. Thank you for this!"
"Precise assesment unto 90-95%. To get proper result, you must input correct information. Update: tested again for other reason and perfectly got the answer...thanks"
"Best symptom checker, don't ask twice just download and use it you will never regreat, i wish i could even rate it seven stars."
"Very well presented app, over all design is easy to use and understand. Also the results they give you are more accurate then I thought they were, but obviously I still went to get a second opinion from a professional, and after hearing what they said, it was about 78% of the time one of the results ada provided."
I love this app. It's proven more useful than the one my doctors surgery provides. I use this before I speak to them now.
"I've only used this App once and it seems quite legit, because I tested it by give symptoms of something I already know I have and it was right, so I would highly recommend this App, thanks keep up the good work"
Very helpful in that it uses all of your symptoms to give most likely causes by probability. GP's should use this as a starting point.
"Ada was ""dead on"". I was diagnosed, by the symptoms that I input, with the very illness that I was diagnosed with back in 1997, and throughout the years that followed. Ada provided me with a very accurate assessment. There was also plenty of information and treatment options provided. I was pleased with the entire application. I plan to use it often in the future, to help myself, family and friends."
interface could better need more information when user tap i don't understand the meaning and overall very best app for diagnosis.
"So far, I like this app. It will, in my opinion, provide a clearer picture for doctors (especially those M.D.s who tend NOT to listen to those of us who DO know our bodies! ... Last suggestion of importance, you need marketing blasts - especially in medical/doctors offices, hospitals, popular med magazines like WebMD and et al."
Good to use
I can't log into my account at all and it says to contact customer service what is wrong!!
"Very quick process, and a very simple App to use."
Excellent source of information thank you ❤️
Helpful . Ad-free . Simple to use. Effective . Clean UI.
"Absolutely brilliant. Couldn't believe the outcome, results on profile of symptoms were 100% correct. Will never delete app. Highly recommend. Excellent and easy to use. Love it"
"Very user friendly, so easy to use. A lot of the other apps out there really frustrated me this app is smooth. Type in your symptoms even if they only make sense to you.. and ada will help you piece it all together piece by piece and you will figure it all out. :)"
Easy to use
Easy to use accurate results
"perfect app, makes easy to look for health information."
"Edit: Still feel exactly the same! Excellent, in-depth symptom questions to try and assist in figuring out what may be happening with the body. Great app that has good, up-to-date information. It works well with no lag or force closing. Ada is my new health BFF!"
No problems whatsoever. Ada asked very well understandable questions about the symptoms and gave the right advice. 5/5 Definitely recommendable.
"A very helpful app. The many times I used this application, I get the right results when I visit the doctors office. Thanks."
So many times this is getting the right diagnosis way faster than the Dr.
The explanations of what might be the problem are in terms easy to understand. I like that it asks you questions after you enter symptoms to help in determining what might be going on. Easy to use.
Actually all information came from this app is fact. And it's pretty accurate when it comes to diagnosis but it's stil best to consult on Doctor if you have serious problems.
ADA is an amazing companion and app. It does exactly what its designed to do. Easy 11/10 any day. Very easy to use
"Pretty accurate heading. Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way."
it keeps closing: i can't even use it.
"Very helpful, And easy to use, Recommended."
Great information
Very helpful information Thank you from NZ
I am a clinician and have tried it on myself. Very accurately diagnosed a condition that cost a lot of cash due to multiple MRIs Awesomeness right here. This app could actually revolutionize healthcare in Kenya.
Lacks info and data
good to use thank you Ada
Well i have never heard of what Ada said it could be but if she is right you would think my doctor would pick up that there is something that is causing me to have repeated chest infection Ada made sense to me thank you you Ada
Quick and easy to use. Well done!
"Highly recommend! This health assessment is thorough and informative. You can choose to track your symptoms over time, which is very convenient for communicating with your doctor. Also, you can create an assessment profile for family/friends; this feature is especially helpful if you have a sick family member or if you're trying to console a friend with illness anxiety. Ada is clean, easy to use, & has no ads. :)"
Great at giving general information on symptoms being experienced.
Good and user friendly app anyone can use it could be in regional languages also
Easy to use. Smooth operation
This app is great! It contains a vast amount of information that is very helpful. Thank you.
Sometimes it gives you the wrong information and makes you feel like that you got that diesease. 1 star
this is the best app on my phone without a doubt! surprisingly accurate every time and so easy to use. no annoying ads and it's entirely free. thank you to the Ada team for creating such an amazing app!
Simple to use but thorough and clear advice.
"It's a great app, informative too and easy to use love it"
It is easy to use and extremely helpful as well as informative though more remedies will be helpful and nice... I love it
"This is an incredibly useful app, it's easy to use, and even though it's not exhaustive it is useful for simple things"
Well worth the time I took to provide every detail! Now I can even choose items/issues I want to track! Icing on the cake! Great app!!!!!
Could not select an applicable option so this clearly is for the most basic of needs. Might as well use the NHS services online if that applies to you.
I liked this app....because it is easy to use also it does not involve ads
It's a really good and helping app I encourage others to use it.
Great. Easy to use. Friendly user interface.
You provide a good general answaers for any health problem
great !! thanks !! I recommend it is easy to use and free the app asks you questions and at the end gives you a diagnosis
It's good help me to get some important information about my health
very easy to use!
Very helpful app for myself and also able to use it to advise my parents. Some stubborn people in the family convinced t I'll go to clinic after assessment by the app.
"Great service, thanks."
Helpfull in regards of health information
the service is good i enjoy it.and they give you an advice on healthcare
Always informative and easy to use.
"This a justifies its purpose, i see nothing wrong with it to be honest. Ada just happened me understand my illness, its all up to me now to go to hospital and get it fixed."
Simple to use and very helpful.
I will always use this app
"Like the app says, its not a definitive medical report. However it asks questions which may prompt realization to a possible cause. Ive used this in may of ways, even passed onto other people and they still use it, you can still cross reference with the NHS information on there website. Today i just used it to find a possible root of my shoulder pain, ada asked the question about any excess physical activity in the past 3 days, turns out yesterday i over did fitness a little bit and forgot."
Always show me a right direction thank you Ada
App military encryption access patient med records voluntary request revocable access would be temporary then trace files would be scrubbed and overwritten from apps servers also if request is made and is needed information should be passed to doctor through secure channel to upadate on possible patient needs to be checked at next visit or need for appointment or emergencybprobalem and maybe haveore specialist doctors engage with the app to tighten up responses and should have vocal interaction
"This app really helps narrow down symptoms and gives you the right information related to your problem, if you have a variety of symptoms it will give you a list of likely causes for your illness but if your problem is thought to be harmful, it will tell you when should go to see a doctor or when to seek urgent treatment. All in all i feel this is an amazing app and really help calm your nerves when you're feeling unsure about your symptoms."
Have not used long enough yet. But so far its been good. The more i use it im sure i can change the stars
Great app with the right set of questions asked.
I felt the questions provide a full list of possibilities and that aids in getting a good assessment.
Simple to use and very informative. Helped me several times already. Thank you!!!
Totally recommend it It really does help a lot especially when you can't go to a hospital..and plus it's really easy and understandable app to use.
I couldn't sign in or use the app. The email verification was faulty
I swear it feels like your having your personal doctor on hand..
Its more helpfully an easy to use
I love this app. Gave it my symptoms and it knew what i had which is very hard to diagnose. I don't ever give a five star rating to apps but this one has been right on spot each and every time.
Very easy to use and extremely helpful
It's that simple and quick and easy to use
Is good to use
Right and simple questions and Right diagnosis...a very good medical helpefully app
Good app to use
I'm happy to use this app it's so good to me and my health
like having my own personal doctor 24/7
I found it helpful and it gives me the information that I need to go see a doctor or not
Amazing and personal
Quick and easy to use
"Been the shy type, I'm so happy I got the right answer to my question."
It give accurate results and easy to use
This app its very useful and applicable it can describe what your problem and provide to you a professional methods to use so as to cue the diseases. I like it
"Great result base on a big data base, great work!"
Told me right away something my doctors have fobbed me off with! Thanks guys!
This app was correct with its diagnosis. I thought I was having appendicitis and the app say kidney infection. Went to the ER and it turned out I had a kidney stone. Will definitely use it again in the future. Thank you to the inventors of this app!!
Good app to have some information about whats happening!
Comes up with a great symptom report for clinical purpose.
I really like it its informative and easy to use
Nailed it. First try. Really helpful app to use before consulting your GP so you have some idea on how to describe your symptoms for their formal assessment.
"So smooth and easy to use, Ada is smart"
Why just I sign up to use? It doesn't make sense!
Easy to use
Very Useful Application. Like a Personal Doctor.
"This app is now a hobo fire. It used to be good. Now it's invasive, and not user-friendly. A nazi-doctor in an app. Probably snitches on you too. Skip it, and just use the online websites, as they give better results anyway"
I like Ada the assessment is perfect It's my personal doctor They however need to advise us on possible medications
please provide an unsubscribe button in your e-mails
Its a very good easy to use app to quickly assess yourself and help recover.
This is really a very helpful app. I am using this from more than 1 year now. It predicts well and gives kinda accurate diagnosis for me. I use this app for self diagnosis for various health symptoms.
This is a fantastic app! my only complaint is that sometimes she repeats a question a bunch of times which is sorta annoying. besides that it has been on point anytime i use this app. Even my doctor was impressed! Good job!
It's a great personal care app!
Thi app is easy to use and can really determined the possible illness of the patient.
"Reliable... I am a physical therapist and I think this is a great app.. You should still see a medical professional for proper diagnosis if urgent.... Would love if Ada could speak too, Like voice automated, just a personal view..."
"Easy to use, clear and detailed"
Easy to use
Brilliant app. Asks you all the right questions.
"Ada is really useful, it gives me relatable information on my symptoms. It's a good one."
This is useful and is just also a great app that I can use when trying to figure things out.
I used Ada more than 3 times already and she never failed to amaze me. She always gets the diagnosis right!
Accurate and easy to use.
Excellent and easy to use
Love this app! It stops me from googling my symptoms which always ended in me thinking I had the black plague or something. Ada is very thorough and very helpful. I use her everytime there is something wrong with me or my kids! Love it! Highly recommend
It's very very helpful app 2 use ...... With alot of advices ... So any one can use it
"Amazing app, always right with my symptoms but sure to point out its not a formal diagnostic. Incredible app!!"
Should definitely use this to know what problems are you facing.
Nice for use
Update: fixed the problem with their initial boot up and was able to move past that section and use the app. Still as great as before!
App is good it should also be available in native language so more people can use it.
Lovely and easy to use
Helps to diagnose symptoms & provide solutions.. Must go ahead with this one
Very happy with this service
Very good and easy to use helps with near every symptom i get very helpful but i still recommend seeing a health care professional first
"Excellent for pointing you in the right direction which helps when speaking to your GP/health advisor,conditions ive been diagnosed with Ada confirms this when i put in my symptoms & advises you to see your doctor"
It's great when you have any health worries+helps give you information to discuss with your GP/Doctor surgery if you have continued health concerns.
Figured out my gallbladder wasnt working and that I had gastritis much quicker than the doctors did. I was in hospital for a week and they hadn't even considered it being my gallbladder but tests have come back and ada was right.
It's very cute. And easy to use and most of the times is very accurate. Feels like a real caring doctor
Easy to use and helped my to diagnose appendicitis
"very helpful especially for those remote from medical services. may God bless the developer more, may you receive more blessings. Continue your service to humanity. thank you very much."
"Very easy to use and understand. Just got the app, so this is my initial perception."
Very easy to use
A very easy to use app. Extremely easy to use and very intuitive. Ensure you have all your symptoms listed and at hand and you will find it one of the best.
I tried my Facebook information and using my two emails to login but it can't. It says that I have an incorrect password which is I have the correct password. I also tried the 'forgot password option' but no help.
"This app is super duper perfect! I'm so busy this week so I can't see doctor,but Ada help me much!This app is so simple to use! Thank you for make this app!"
"My go to when health advice is needed Allows me to avoid googling my symptoms and getting misleasing information. This app gives a range of causes to symptoms, along with the probability based on how many people with the same symptoms had such a cause. Gives advice on whether further medical advice is needed"
Good app explained my medical condition in detail that was better reading than getting an explanation from my gp as they tend to use medical terms that someone with no knowledge of medical can understand. Reading it in basic terms was so helpful for me to understand
Its just perfect to use. I love this app.. I sure recommend to you too
"Easy to use, quick signup and the diagnostic portion is thorough."
In your assessment just use a simple terminology because lots of the user at this application is from non English country so the have problem in understanding your assessment questions all the best thanks for help to the world It is very helpful it help me found my sickness symptoms
Very helpful.Ada is my personal favorite and most useful app on my phone. Assessments are realistic and insightful ❤️❤️❤️love it
It's quite easy to use. Clear English and it's considerate enough to ask detailed questions.
Neat and fun to use
With many information and support to reduce your symptoms
A good app to use! I experienced some sort of relief having contacted ada online. It gave me a clue concerning my health status. It's a pretty nice push medically. Impressive!
"I just downloaded the app, but I like it, it's easy to use, I wouldn't take the diagnosis as the gods truth, but it does seem to be in the ballpark, I'm a retired paramedic and I think the information it gives is useful, it's good for a quick reference about different medical problems, not a substitute for a doctor of course, but it's not made to be one, it is a great app though."
I love this app. It's very helpful and easy to use.
Excelent information that lead better understanding and made easier to discuss with doctor.
"Good app, easy to use with an instant potential answer to medical issues"
I'm very thankful for this app because atleast it gave me an idea about the sickness that I'm encountering right now.
Helpful and easy to use app
Helpful and easy to use.
Sounds right from what I learned in my medical training class
Cool app. Very informative. Very helpful. Use when problem occurs.
I feel like it is almost right on point with the diagnosis after you answer the questions about your symptoms. I will continue using the Ada App.
Easy to use and reassuring....
Easy to use.. Helpful diagnosis.
Brilliant app that is so easy to use and gives great results. Remember not to take it as gospel though lol!!
This is the most useful health app so far. Whenever I felt some unexplainable cause of pain I usually use this app. It will asked you some question to came up with the result or cause of the underlying pain. And it's amazing because what I actually thought the cause of the pain I've been feeling matches with the suggested results. It's like pre-consultation before you go to the doctor.
Best app it has good and satisfying reports best app for personal assistant just wow wow wow♥️♥️♥️
"Very helpful application, I always use it to tress out what's wrong with my health before seeing the doctor."
Good information
Great experience. Accurate information.
Good app. So far appears accurate. I only wish there was a share feature so I could share overviews and information online or with friends and family.
Easy to use and informative. Better than worrying yourself on google.
Ada has been helpful in diagnosing myself and others. I like that it gives probabilities of multiple diagnoses. The level of questioning makes me feel like it has a thorough enough data set in order to correctly diagnose someone. Even though it's not a medical diagnosis it is comforting to know what the most likely possibilities are. Thank you for putting out this app!
I use this before I seek medical advice as the questions here help me prepare myself when talking to an actual physician
I use this app all the time. It's very useful
"I love it! It has every single information, question and answer!"
Its a good App and helpfull try use it
Easy to use and reassuring. Given the problems with the NHS at the moment I would recommend everyone signs up for this app.
It work well and provide a good service
I used Ada and it diagnosis right on the mark. I will definitely tell my friends to check out this app
Right on
Very easy to use and clear language for normal people.
This is a great symptom checker. Asks appropriate questions for the information it is receiving from you. Would recommend.
Awesome app i got all the info i needed. I have to add that you guys are great for creating this app. It's so easy to use and better then web MD. Thank you again..
Very easy to use. Detailed questions on symptoms.
Honestly helped before going to the doctor and it was helpful Ada symptom checkers is pretty accurate in my experience It was right I had bronchitis
"Excellent app, I am a healthcare practitioner, If you want to improve it more then you need to add the option to input lab. Tests, ECG, imagings....etc Or even asking the user do it and then input it in ada, This will be great update and will provide more accurate confidant results which may be comparative to a specialized doctor, Thank you."
"My grandpa was saved because of this app. 4 years ago, my grandpa was feeling very sick. We did the test and it told us to go to a hospital with urgency. It was right. A couple of minutes more, and he would have died. Thanks, Ada!"
Good and Easy to Use it
"I absolutely love this app! Ada helped me on countless occasions. The app is simple to use. After, I input my key health indicators, Ada is able to generate a short list of probable causes. Starting from most likely to be caused from...to least likely. Then it is able to identify possible conditions & treatment related to my symptoms. In my opinion, Ada has a good understanding of health concerns and its manifestations. Ada is a ""smart"" app. She learns as she goes, and gets better with time."
"Its nice, good interface, helping and easy to use. Liked it! 5star pls"
Easy sign up! App is easy to use and accurate. I will continue to use and let others know about this app. It's definitely worth downloading.
"A app at least right from Google, point of view of death."
"easy to use, easy to understand, etc. very good app :]"
Very accurate information
"Don't know if this is a glitch, but it won't let me 'save and continue' my privacy and data stuff, even if I 'consent to all' the 'save and continue' button does nothing... Haven't even gotten into the app yet"
Awesome app always spot on in giving accurate information
"The app is good, it is accurate information on diseases for the symptoms provided and explains the diseases perfectly. Wonderful app🙏💪"
"Very useful! It's great to be able to find out what minor issue I'm having like an illness so I can use ways to help my body heal faster, I wouldn't use it for anything major as the result the app gives is not a formal diagnosis, but other than that it's fantastic"
"It's a nice app, and all just hate the fact that you have to sign in to it every time you want to use it"
Mostly very helpful I personally use it for me n my family n it has never been too far from the truth
"In the article about it, is written that you can enter blood test results and get an analysis. Unfortunately there is no such feature. Also, there is no any inapp support. I choose to uninstall for a while"
"This app utilizes really smart technology to provide the best possible diagnosis and treatment,,, I give it a 5 🌟 review"
"Most helpful. Easy to use. Accurate. Informative. Most importantly, it's free without ads."
incredibly helpful always easy to use though I would like for medications to be accounted in the diagnosis. And the option to enter pronouns for yours and others profile would make the app more inclusive.
I've been down for most of my life and have never wanted to reach out for help because of my random mood swings. I still had that feeling when trying this app until I saw that it went further in depth of what my condition could be or if I have one at all. It's given me something I could use to chat with a doctor about and for that I can be thankful for.
"Very easy to use, breaks down multiple options and gives you the statistical probability of number of people who present w the same symptoms n what it is that they have in comparison. Pretty cool app"
"I just used ""Ada"" for the first time after I read an article where the most common system checker is rated in 5th place & Ada is in FIRST place! I was none-the-less pleasantly surprised!!! Creating an account was simple & selecting my symptoms was just as easy. I was asked all the right questions for each symptom I listed. And the non-official list of several possible diagnosis went further to explain all about each one. I am able to work on my health issue since I now have the facts!"
"Fantastic app! Listens and asks questions better than my own doc! Then gives me information on possible causes for my illness. Truly an amazing app, and so perfect, especially now days when it's so hard, or even dangerous because of COVID, to even get in to see a doctor. It's a 10 outta 10 for me!"
Very easy to use. Understood the diagnosis as not over complicated.
"Diagnostic tool easy to use, not sure I want to say I hope it's accurate but it's certainly prompted a doctors visit. Pleased there were no hidden charges, all seems geared up to help the individual rather than make a profit which is a welcome change in the current climate."
First time to use. And very interesting!
Good information
Awesome & ready helpful use to narrow down to what is likely the answer
The best app that gives me all the information I need know about my health condition.
Easy to use and helpfull
I could not find a flaw in this though I've only used it once it was straight-to-the-point very precise do you have took it the time making sure that all the information was in place even things that I could not think up I will definitely use this app again in the future
All service in ada health is so nice
Seems to be on target with previous medical diagnosis. This Symptom checker is more comprehensive than WebMD symptom checker and easier to use.
Easy to use
Very helpful and so easy to use.
"Consider this is as first aid kit, it will give possible conditions based on your personal or dearones symptoms. Obviously if first aid is enough or no medicines or diagnosis is required you don't need to visit the doctor. If not, it will recommend to visit the doctor for better understanding. I hope inventor of this app, take aid from AI and give what tests patient may need to go through or what is the possible time they need to take rest for disease, it will be helpful to the user to estimate."
"This app helped me to seek the Right specialist thanks for your effort I hope this app will be used more, help ppl more in hospitals instead of waiting your turn you can sit and check your symptoms and all exam can be done than set you appointment with the right doc .. just dreaming of a better world"
Very easy to use and understand. No ads!
"Its surprisingly good, helps detect symptoms which could have been overlooked by a patient. Extremely helpful. It is very helpful in rural areas. It is my personal doctor. It could be improved. Basic line of treatment ought to be shown eg. NSAIDs or antibiotics etc"
This app is AMAZING!! It was right on target! I was shocked!
I always use this app to check my symptoms and see if I should go to the doctor. 10/10 definitely recommend.
Survey asked a lot of questions. Very inquisitive but it's good to put my information out to help. Somebody can help me especially with the burning of the feet sometimes and my high blood pressure I try to keep it under control with medication
"This app is very good with questions and possible avenues for your symptoms. I highly recommend it if you want to get a jump on what might be going on ... especially if you can't get to the doctor right away. Thanks, Ada! 🙏🏼"
The check your health app was very helpful and simple-to-use
"Good app, easy to use"
"It's a good medical aid in both learning, researching and clinical use"
"On my initial use, I was impressed with the way I was asked further questions about symptoms when I indicated I was through. Of course I had omitted some! Creating a PDF file works, but didn't seem to until I left the app. The information included was extensive. As I use this app, I will try to remember to update my experience."
"I absolutely love this app and I have been using it for years as my first point of call! It is incredibly accurate, easy to use and informative."
"Easy to use, but not wonderfully accurate (yet more accurate than many other similar apps)"
"Very easy to use, accurate and is based on questions it asks you personally instead of blanket questions n answers that cud be from anyone."
Good Service
A really great app and easy to use. Always leads to a correct diagnosis although not always as it is not a professional medical advice
"Honestly a fantastic app, it's so easy to use and digest for anyone. All the information and questions provided are relevant and conclude with a really well set out report. No complications, no bugs just a really useful tool for anyone with health queries."
"I am speechless with what this app can do. It feels like I have a doctor in my hand, I visited the hospital and the results were the same as the Ada app. I strongly recommend the use of this app.!"
Required email verification and personal info. Slow responding to answers
Very easy to use and understand. Very informative!
The assessment was right on.
Impressive assessment and provision of information
"Pretty sure they make money with my data, but the results are often helpful."
"Gives a general idea of possibilities of a round about guess of indications. Answers give assistance for a person to get a logical assessment and provides a detailed starting point to further their medical diagnosis. Of course, a person should take this information to your GP and never self diagnosis."
Really good app. The results for symptoms are very good. You can't go wrong. Simple to use. No other app is as straight forward as this one. 🙂
Was very easy to use
Is very simple to use
Very useful information for my systems.
Very nice app accurate and it provides true information if you faithfully fill the blanks
Very good information about some complex medical information.
"Very informational, and accurate. But don't use this app as a diagnosis."
"I'm always worried about my health, especially when my body seems to be doing something new. Ada has actually been very helpful in hinting me on my issues and I honestly feel better. The diagnosis' have usually been right like the last time I went to get checked out, BUT Ada is mainly accurate when you KNOW what your symptoms are (can appropriately identify them). So sometimes I have to go back, if I didn't understand a symptom and choose the right one. UPDATE: THE APP GOT BETTER."
"This app is more than a doctor. What you could have spent so much money for, but this app will give you for free. I often use it whenever I'm not feeling well."
Suggested anemia when two doctors didn't think of it. Ada was right. All hail our virtual overlords!
"Really thorough, let's you record many symptoms. Asks you prompt questions. Diagnosis is given more than one option, with percentage of people who had those symptoms and diagnosis. Then gives more information on each possible diagnosis."
"This app was great. No annoying ads and nothing but just what it was for. Awesome app, got the diagnosis right on target."
This app is pretty cool. Hoping it broadens things to include types of flu or common cold. Right now still learning it but it diagnosed my auto immune when I tested it.
This app has been very helpful to keep track of my symptoms over time so that I can share them with my health care providers. It helps them get me to the right specialist and medication. If you are someone who's expecting a lot of health issues this app is a great idea. Try it.
This app is so easy to use
"I think this is a fantastic app that helps me manage my health anxiety. Symptom assessments are thorough, clear and even provide guidance if you're not sure what something means. The symptom assessments help me rationalise my thoughts well and avoid panic. Thank you!"
Easy to use with a lot of information.
"Fed symptoms already diagnosed for fun and she got them all right! Go Ada! She has very details symptoms also, pretty helpful. Just type in a general word and things pop up."
"Super useful app, I use it all the times, usually if I'm unsure if to call a doctor, it gives you all the possible problems that could cause your simptom while also giving wich ones are likely and which ones are very unlikely"
"Information provided are helpful, easy to understand & just enough. Also easy to use."
Very helpful. Been using this since 2017 and the improvement was there are tips inside the app. Very helpful! Please continue your service ❤️
Very easy and convenient to use. It helps me know my condition before getting to the hospital.
very nice app to use in daily health status check up.
"It's a Good app, fast easy to use, a suggestion please make a dark mode, also please give us more answer options: always, never, rarely, often..."
Its really good quite accurate and often in the right ballpark most errors os from putting wrong symptoms the only thing to make it better and a perfect five stars is of they add a option for pain comes and goes and if you can select multiple regions off the body also if ada maybe had a professional consultant like a doctor or nurse for advice that'd make it even better. TL:DR Ada is great and there is mild improvements that can be made overall very helpful
This seems to have a good accuracy. It is good to know more information about what you may possibly have. It is useful.
Great app. Easy to use
"Doctors couldn't tell what was wrong with my grandma. They discharged her saying that she's only depressed. I used Ada and instantly received her diagnosis. We called the ambulance again next day. She sadly died in the hospital. Autopsy confirmed what this app said. I also used it for myself, and after I did some tests, I discovered two lumps on my thyroid. App was again pretty spot on. It's good to use in order to see which doctor to visit sooner or what tests to get done first."
Very detailed and accurate assessments. Easy to use and the information is clear and easy to understand. Recommend highly!
Really unfortunate. There's no other app like it so this really could have been a powerhouse of an app with 100 millions of downloads it does what I needs to do but the need for an account is so tedious I won't use it when it won't even let me use my clipboard to paste a password
Everything I described they were right cause I heard all of it before from my own Dr's
"Honestly this is third time used, but worst one yet. But could not explain symptoms correctly, it would be half right or wrong in the symptoms part. And last 2 were spot on. So give it a try and pay attention to your symptoms."
"Great app, I like that it asks questions after getting all your symptoms, pretty spot on for me each time. I also like that it tracks your symptoms . obviously it doesnt replace my doctor but sometimes you just need to know what it might be and you can't always get right into a doctor. just have to try it for yourself to know, its definitely a good app to have."
Very easy to use as well as thorough. The app is very clear with the information given. I was surprised!
Great app! Free App Download. Easy & Cery User-Friendly. I suggest anyone to download right away needing to check any symptoms they may have. I♥️ThisApp!
very helpful and easy to use
"Spot on, asks all the right questions and very helpful"
Easy to use and understand
"I have been using it since 2021, It was good and working fine. My rating was 5, until I updated. I couldn't use it anymore. Instead, I see tips and information I can easily get on the Internet without having to download any apps. The new update is not user-friendly."
Great information that my doctor confirmed.
Fast and good service ...I get more aware in taking care of my self and also my family with this app.Godbless.
I like it will use it again
Went to the doctor and turns out Ada was right highly recommend
Very informative and easy to use
Very helpful & easy to use
"I downloaded it, and before I open it, you ask to agree that my information be used amd shared by you and third parties in order to send me offers. This is a big NO."
Found this app to be helpful..would definitely use it again.
Very informative containing lots of information.
I've used this app for a while. It's very easy to use and gives great suggestions. I turn to Ada 1st when there's an injury or illness in my home!
Love the experience so quick and easy to use and love how thorough they are when ask questions.
Satisfied with the service
It's like my own personal hospital five star for me
Right/Wrong--Contrary.
"I like the app. It helps a lot if you are also hypochondriac, so instead of googling non stop symptoms I use ADA. 8 out of 10 the Dr will said the same. It makes me no worry excessively"
This is awesome app I'm helpful with this service keep it up
Very good and intuitive. Easy to use and helpful to find the cause and possible treatments to help alleviate and solve health problems.
"Most accurate (free) symptom checker app I've used. I appreciate that it lets you create and save multiple profiles for different people and input their information separately. For me the the only negative would be that sometimes the follow-up questions only have one or two choices for answers, and sometimes the available answers either don't really apply or are not exactly accurate. But overall good app! Would definately recommend!"
This app is perfect i use it whenever i start feeling symptoms so that it tell me if it's urgent or not and sometimes it's just a cold so i take cold medicine and get better quicker. It's as accurate as doctors at this point i love whoever created this fr
Easy to use! Accurate.
"I LOVE this APP. It's got it all, and very effective, efficient and more information than I could consume. I love the multiple possible diagnosis the best, but it always gives you a chart showing what percentage each of your symptoms occur in others. Thanks so much. I have been looking for a app like this forever and FINALLY I have it."
Very easy to use. Asks the same questions a medical professional would ask.
Very much helpful! & full of useful information
Life saving advice and information that can help with any condition.
Good information
The only problems I really have with this app is that it doesn't use the information of your medications in assessments. I also think it would be more accurate if you could list the conditions you've already been diagnosed with. There was also one time that it just randomly logged me out of my account. But overall I'd say this is a pretty good app for checking your symptoms.
Very easy to use and helpful in finding out the problem with only few questions
"Very well, thank you, and you can add the Arabic language to provide more"
Good service
"Correctly assessed me for Fibromyalgia. I had to list so many different symptoms, I thought I'd mess it up... nope! I'll use this in the future if I get sick."
"Will you be using AI like chatgpt to be more natural at asking questions or providing more options to describe symptoms. Also, AI may help to provide literature references to support the result or provide more evidence based insight"
"Using it since 2017, It's accuracy is 99.9% most of the time. First time, It helped me to take a good decision for my father (it suggested get hospitalized) and he was diagnosed with clot. Ada helped me to take right decisions. Not only 1 time, but many times. I am thankful and grateful for all the hardworking and generous developers. May God bless your every aspect of life. May his abundance visible to all in all what you do. Thanks again 🙏"
Easy to use and probably correct in diagnosis.
Can't open the app beyond the privacy information sheet (Google Pixel)
"Very helpful, amazzing app.i use it all the time for me and my family"
Nice app and always friendly to use
"Very helpful app,gives 90% information that leads one to know where to start medical wise"
Amazingly easy to use yet accurate diagnoses. I can highly recommend it! One suggestion to make it even better: it could ask to enter/supply existing medical records or test results.
"Good questions , and hopefully the right answers - I shall make an appointment with doctor for further information - thanks"
My first experience gave spot on information in regards to my symptoms. I didn't expect it to be so good.
Amazing and very much so a great app to use!!!
"Pls only use app as a guide and not if you have the tendancy to be a hypochondriac, in the nicest possible way"
Very great app to assess your symptoms and find out what could be wrong with you. You can tell ada all your symptoms and it usually is correct on the possible diagnosis. Ada will tell you when to seek emergency care or when to talk with a doctor. Very great app if your unsure if u should see a doctor right away or seek emergency help. This app is very helpful. I've been using ada for three years now. It's very excellent and I would highly recommend.
"I am unable to create an account. The boxes that need to be ticked are ghosted out. I can only review the service once it becomes functional, hence the single star rating ☹️"
"So easy to use, very thorough questions. Very recommended!!"
"Ada is the best app for immediate assessment on yr health, i recommend people to use ADA app."
Add option to tell it about things i have done or something that i ate recently so it can guess more accurately. I dont fully believe on what it reports. I just use it to identify many of the unknown symptoms.
Very easy to use
This app is SO detailed and asks just the right questions. I will present my suggestions to my doc.
Ada quiet possibly saved my life! My quick thinking they recognized something wasn't right and that therefore led me to Ada caught my heart attack symptoms so that I was able to get emergency medical care just moments before it's onset! Thank you Ada!!
"Was good but no more privacy, this literally shares your medical history and they do not disclose where to (read their privacy policy) It says that it's not possible to asses the symptoms without processing the data. That's not true at all. all I want this to do is use proven medical data (NOT data collected from this app) to give an assessment I want to see what the app THINKS is wrong, that is all Sure it's needed for OTHER features, but let me use the app without accepting that privacy bull"
Great
"was on point with the diagnosis. When I entered all my symptoms, it told me exactly what my doctor told me was the problem. My 1st attempt I didn't fully understand but I then realize I could type exactly what my symptoms are and not just select what was shown in the app... 10 stars rating it if was possible."
Great
Iys really helpfull and very specific i really like it☺
Good app
It can help u know whats going on first by mostly synchologically
Very helpful I can now go to doctor with some idea on what my problem could be
I love this . It help one to think deeply about his or her body conditions. Good work .
Great app for health related issues
Very good and slightly sexy
"Overalls pretty good for common illnesses. Seems ok, not that much different than going onto WebMD except it seems more thorough with questions. However seems to have mostly common disorders and lacks many of the rarer ones. A tutorial would have been nice for the app as well."
Good reports and helps a lot!
Great
Was very functional for me and she say me all the things i have
Superb and helpful
Good app
it's good app and more helpful than ever! thank you more!
Very helpful and educational
Can't log on anymore
Awesome experience
"When Ada works, the medical guidance is excellent. But very basic app controls are missing (standard in similar alps); there is no ""back"" button and no ""restart"" button. This causes users lots of effort when a small mistake is made on answeting questions. It also causes inappropriate Ada requests for button clicks when restarting after a crash. And if Ada crashes just after you ask for a report or while you are reading a teport, say goodbyw to the report. You just have to start again --- ugh!!!"
The question part is very nice ...
Perfect
Good and helpful..
Perfect
Really helpful. As good as physical clinical diagnosis.
Good app
Good app
Very very helpful
"Very good and helpful. At least with the online consultation with Ada, you have an idea of what you're suffering from."
Educating
The BEST
Satisfied
This is a very helpful app and please make sure if you can include more pictures.
The best app so far....I just discovered what has been troubling me for a long period now.... went to the hospital and got same results
Really helps you try find out whats wrong with you
very helpful and efficient app.Thanks a lot Ada
Great
It perfectly matches a diagnosis I had 7 years ago.
Very helpful.
It's a wonderful app. Thumbs up to the creators..
Gives you a clue as what could be wrong .puts your mind at rest
If you have a bad surgery/dorctets this is the app for you it stops going to the dorcters for no reason
Amazing. I've been getting chills (I feel like I'm freezing) with a bit of dizziness and pain in my jaw joint - Ada suggested it might be Hashimotos Thyroid and was dead on. 5/5 would recommend!
awesome and helpful
Amazing app with potential for greatness I tried something which I had been experiencing and the diagnosis was on point you could try it with something you are sure off and see if this app is on point
Really helpful
Good app
It's very helpful and user friendly too
A guide to whether to bother your doctor or not
Excellent and helpful
It's an excellent health companion. I love it!
Nice app anytime anyday
The info was very helpfull
Looks like patient been attended to by physically visible doctor. 💟
I believe this can be very helpful in the future
Really enjoy using this app to narrow down the causes of my issues.
Quite helpful that makes easy to understand the question.
Great app
Great
Amazing app... Helps me check on my health symptoms before going to the doctor...prity helpful
It's damn correct
Good additional resource for maintaining health and avoiding unnecessary health care visits and costs.
"This app is very helpful, thank you alot"
I found this app for diagnosis of medical illness
Awesome app... No word to describe.
Best health app ever. Their diagnosis is as accurate as the diagnosis I got from the hospital
"Great app, very helpful and informative"
Cool
Very helpful.
"Great. ,,..,,"
Its good
I was recently diagnosed and this app reaffirmed what the doctors told me so this was extremely accurate! 5 stars from me
Just great!
Put my mind at ease .. love it !
Feels like being interrogated by a real doctor
Nice app can explain the sympotoms and give solution to the couseof the symtoms
Very helpful not regeting downloading it
Very good app
Is one of the best out there guys. Trust me. And you won't regret downloading this app. Keep the good work guys.
This app is simply wonderful! I have confidence in its diagnosis. It is highly recommend.
Good and helpful app Keep on with the good work
Works great
The App is so informative
"Ada covers every angle and every possible questions asked, and the lists of ""possible results"" is amazing. This app truly makes me feel at ease knowing what my conditions are at all times of need. I LOVE IT!! Tina Trujillo"
Cool app. Love the questions
Not bad....just downloaded it and tested it once. More feedback will come later.
very helpful
Very accurate
I just started using this app and I like it already. It is very informative.
It's very helpful
Good app it really helps me a lot
"Very easy to understand and accurate, in it's health predictions. I put in the symptoms three different times for three different health issues I've already been diagnosed with and it predicted the correct health condition each time. This is very nice and great for people to bring to their doctors. Or seek help if they're not sure."
"I was surprised at the accuracy of this app. I put in my symptoms from the sickness I had a few weeks ago and it correctly identified it as the flu. Thinking maybe that was too easy, I put in symptoms that I've been experiencing for a few years that I believe to be possible ADHD, and it detected that as well. I'm very impressed with the quality and simplicity."
Its awesome even the doctor said the same.
It's a good app
it really helps to know your health
Answered the questions. I already knew my diagnosis as I've had it many years now. Adam was bang on!
"App very helpful, gives a thorough analysis. I found Ada to be excellent tool to research health issues, for my father & my own family."
Perfect app.
It was helpful. I will keep using it.
Some how it help to know what you should do after their report. When you give them your symptoms.
Very exceptional!
It's pretty good at narrowing down your symptoms so you and your doctor can focus on that rathet than doing random tests
Itd been incredibly wonderful from the very first day instarted using the app
Its so helpfull thnks
Great app by all standards.
Perfect
"i think this is the best app i have come across,its helpful."
Its good app
"Surprisingly accurate, however it doesn't pick up on some of my health conditions."
Very helpful
i learnt alot from the app thanks
Nice and comprehensive
The app is very good and helpful. I like it
it helps a lot
"Very apt.Ada helped to diagnose what exactly is wrong with me.Now,I can face my problems squarely."
"Great piece of app, perfectly designed."
Super. Thank you developers!
Great.
I love this app its helpful thanks Ada health
Very good... It helps me alot
Good app
"It was really great, thanks alot I appreciate"
It's a great application and the response are fast and accurate but it should be lite so that it will work when the network is not too strong.
Still on the fence.... Just downloaded so it's too soon to really give my honest rating!
Must download
Very interesting results
It worked well for me...thanks!
Tried using the app to diagnose myself and it's really useful. A lot of questions were asked and the report is very thorough.
I have never experienced an app that is so thorough and understanding! This app is amazing! Would recommend!
I love it its fast and rapid
This app is really good. I love it
Extremely accurate diagnosis that agrees which my doctor who is rated highly nationally
It is very nice application
Its very user friendly and it was very helpful
"Very very thourogh, almost better than a real doctor."
Great
"It temporarily serves as a doctor as well as firstaid point. In case of emergency, Ada would no doubt help before reaching to a clinic or hospital for proper medical investigation."
"Ada is like my second opinion. I checked with my doctor and then i used Ada and discovered the same prognosis as my doctor so, i find that very comforting. Thanks, Ada!!"
"Thanks, perfect medical app, bravo"
Perfect
"Very helpful at times when you are scared something serious health issues, but this app makes you calm."
Its very good
I tested this it actually diagnosed narcolepsy which I know I have but took doctors 34 years to diagnose me !!
Very accurate👌🙏
Very clear and pictorial explanations helped even more in dissecting difficult medical term
Wish it had diagnostics for kids
This is good
Great app
Great
Great app! Helps with the possibilities or diagnosis of symptoms.
One step closer to having a tricorder. AI diagnosis isn't perfect but it's a step towards alleviating anxiety over unknown conditions.
Easy to understand questions and answers in a logical sequence
Amazing and helpful
This app is very helpful to me as a mom its important for me to secure the health of my family i very love this app
Great
Great
Just started using this app today and I find useful
Satisfactory
It's a very great app.
nice app. it helped me decide on what to do! it's like your seeing a doctor virtually. good job developers of Ada.
Excellent breakdown of possible diagnosis very well explained would highly reccomend to anyone needing piece of mind. And helping to give u a much better idea of symptoms as well as treatment options serious or non serious.
Great app
Good but it would be best if Ada could give a repost with a drug list of the problem cause some people may live in a country or area with less knowledge doctors
Its good to have it
Awesome app. Would recommend 100%
I like Ada because even if very few symptoms reports match your overall condition it gives you a wide variety of possibilities for you to read through yourself and then advises a course of action based on that result which has helped me a lot with more minor concerns.
"Nice app, recommend it to anyone"
great help me with my symptoms deafenetly made me feel asured .just gave me an idea what i thought was going on with my symtams
"Ok, I've send a mail to them. Got a reply from them within a hour or so. Problem solved. Must say sorry for previous bad review. 1st review Don't even want to give one star. Been waiting for that confirmation mail to complete registration for a week now. 😧"
Very effective
Perfect
Very helpful.A must have app
I like this app.
A great way to utilize the power of a smartphone
I recommend this application. Because it is extremely useful and helpful.
"Very helpful, especially when you're looking for possible problems and what to do about them"
It's a very great app and helpful too
This app is amazing it asks you a few questions which then tells you possible causes for your symptoms. A thing that they could improve upon is maybe creating prescriptions upon tour symptoms
Best app to be installed on someone else's phone. To check your health is good 😊...👍
Good enough
Very impressed
This app is a great help. I hope everyone has a nice day.
Good app
Very helpful
"It is very useful. You should add simptomes to choose from, not just to write them📝."

Good at telling you about your illness would highly recommend
Pretty informative.
Pretty Accurate But Always See A Doctor
This is a great app! It's handy in getting an idea of what may be bothering your child when it's too hard for them to tell you exactly.
For health care and medical consultant seekers please download this application it will help you alot. For my thoughts of app improvement please make an addition of more pictures of explaining the sympton and part of translation in the application to be used for such words. thank you!!!
Surprisingly. Prompt and efficient.
Very helpful
Amazing though it should have various language choices just incase for people who do not understand english well
I am happy and this is very helpful to have this app is my first time on it I think I will recommend that to my family members and Friends
10/10. I am very happy with the developer thanks for this app
I love this app
"very helpful app. gives good advice as to what could be wrong, what to do and who to see."
If you get sick or have a new symptom pop up and you tend to search the internet before going to a doctor - this is the app for you! It feels accurate and professional and asks relevant questions to give you an idea of what may be wrong.
Awesome app
This app has been very helpful to me
Dont want seeing this App advertisement through my phone
"I was skeptical so I tried the app. I have a hard to diagnose autoimmune disease, I input the info, answered the questions honestly and it told me what I have!"
The best ever
"better than googling symptoms. if you can identify what bothers you well it's perfect to demonstrate whether you need to worry or not. It's not perfect of course, for example I once used it for hip pain and it was something a little serious that it couldn't identify because it was super specific, but it was pretty clear about the fact that it was something to get checked out, and I think that's the important part for me."
Its so good help everyone.there is many explaination for our deseas just download its to help you
"Not bad,good health app"
Happy with everything
I don't understand and can't follow all I get are questions and add. Poorly built
Really helps in confirming doctors diagnosis.
"I couldn't get past the verify your email page, I could be dying man and I won't know because of the ""verify your email"" thing"
Was great giving me an idea of what my symptoms could be
"Its a good App, very helpful and indeed it is the best ... thank you"
Hopless app can't even find out the symtom of the diases
"Great little app! Track symptoms, get an assessment/instructions on what to do about it."
Really If you have 100 star i will give you best of luck and thanks a lot
I hate this app! I can't believe you have to be over 16 to get Ada! Ada is supposed to help *EVERYONE* stay healthy? What if I'm sick and can't go to a doctor? What then? Hope your happy!
Really helped when feeling like I was dying
Very precise and imformative. Ty
Excellent and very helpful application
A good app. It will hint the probable health problems so that we can take care..
Awesome and also helpful!
I so love this app is so helpful
Great app
Very helpful app
Very good on my first try
"I had a hard time breathing and it told me some scary diagnosis, but it turned out to be false. I just had this thing when you breathe in too much air and get used to this amount and just have to learn to breathe less again. (And you feel like you can't breathe in enough) It's quite common among ppl but got me scared"
"Ada is very helpful. You can tell her any symptons that you may have,and she'll help you and tell you what it is. She recommends help which is great."
Great
Thank you
I love this application! So much better than googling symptoms. Almost always gives accurate result.
Very good app
"I've had health issues since childhood but at 32 declined rapidly & was sent to Temple Univ Hosp for diagnosis. After 5 specialists treated me, their combined conclusion was Fibromyalgia w/100+ lab reports/tests/blood analysis as ”verified proof."" Only 1 of 5 of my local drs accepted their opinion & followed their advice. The others told me the only treatment I needed was psychiatric & ignored their advice. ADA, after seeing my symptoms, agreed with Temple Univ. Hospital too."
This app is a life saver.
It is useful apps better to improve on tretement suggestions rather than physician assistant.
"You have to be really detailed with the symptoms, but is really accurate. I highly recommend this app."
"Very accurate questions, it summarized my condition"
Very informative
For only one day at this time of using this app (Ada) I have gain alot of skills not only because am a nurse but how good you are in answering and questioning.
The Dr was great I will be using him again
The system is nice for the patient to get a light on what to do
"I love this app, it's very helpful"
Very helpful
It solves problems to a certain point
Very accurate
Diagnosed my aunt's Plantar Fasciitis and my hypotension. Confirmed with doctor. Recommend 100%. Every phone needs this.
Still trying it out but it's been amazing so far.
Very nice app
"Doctor doctor, tell me the truth. I gotta hot :0"
Very helpful
Good app
Really good if you're worried about your symptoms and it doesn't give you irrelevant stuff to worry you. It tailors the possible causes to your symptoms and tells you how likely you're to get that
Good app
Nice and efficient app.👍

A very useful health diagnosis app. At least I'm informed about the possible sickness based on my symptoms before I see a doctor and usually it turns out to be one of the app's prediction... Good job guys.

Perfect one don't miss it help sometimes

Interesting
Best health app ever seen
It's very helpful in many ways
"I can't type in the ""what could I do better?"" field at the end of the diagnostic. When I click in the box the keyboard comes up but disappears immediately, leaving me no way to type."
The app was so helpful for my condition
Very good useful to developers please add temperature readings or sensors
"Very helpful app. Gives great feedback and diagnosis of symptoms you may have and fives great facts as well. Would be an app for someone who may not have/want someone to talk to about their body and problems, and whether or not to seek real help in the form of going to a doctor, but the app tells you that anyways. All in all, a wonderful app for your health questions or concerns!"
Super helpful 👍
Perfect
Its really a very good helping app. Helping for every age of people and against every disease. Great job done.
Really helps out once u get the hang of it ! I love it because it's really good for generalizing what you have so you know what to do with it! I also love how it gives you an out of 10 way how your symptoms match with the illness.
It's helpful
Horrible!!!!! Says I've sepsis
Excellent app for health related issues.
"Found the ADA app pretty good. Was spot on with a condition my doctor diagnosed, and which I'm being treated for, and gave me a pretty comprehensive suggestion regarding another Condition which has bothered me."
"In light of times where people panic about their symptoms, this can really give you a sense of peace knowing what might actually cause you minor troubles."
"This app is very nice,"
Satisified with results
I would give it 0 stars if I could. I've been trying to do an assessment all weekend and it keeps glitching and starting me over. Deleting the app immediately because I'm in a health crisis and this is only making it worse.
"I love how thorough this app is. I was able to understand the different diagnosis that there could of been clearly and fully. It also wasn't overwhelming like a lot of the other diagnoses apps are where they list far too many possibilities and it makes you more paranoid then you are already. I would recommend this app over the even the more popular and older sites like web md. Thanks, Ada!"
So far it's pretty good. It's all really accurate!
good app
can't log in however many times i tried
Very helpful and handy

"This platform is awesome, it tells you exactly what's in you"

"A bit stressful when trying to register otherwise very handy and amazing app with accurate, infact perfect reports! Whoever is incharge really knows what they are doing and damn good at it👌"

Very Helpful!
The app has been pretty useful for identifying when something can be worse than it seems. People don't really ever think to just go see their doctors and it can be a pain to get an appointment so ada is a good way of alerting people when they may need medical advice/treatment and has a few tips on how you can help the recovery process or prevent the incident in the future.
Cool
Helpful and careing
Great app ever
A very helpful app
Very helpful
Totally useless ask for all the symptoms but only paid attention to first symptom mentioned
Very informative
Definitely cool and helpful. and the BEST PART...... ITS FREE!!!!!!
So far fantastic.
Most apps give me the run around. Ada is here to strictly assist my health concerns and symptoms. This is one App I'm going to keep using. Thank You
It is a great app im sure it will help me in the future ~corbin_0w0

It was fruitful
"Couldnt verify my email. Got stuck on ""verify email"" page in app, despite verifying ot via email 3 times."
Ada is a very helpful app. It actually revealed what u was suffering from to me. I had actually gone to the hospital to be diagnosed with the same condition. I wanted to check for its accuracy and it proved to me that it is the best.
Good app
It was like going to the doctor only I don't have to pay
Wonderful app
"Why do you force people to sign up for newsletters to continue with registration??? So annoying, I quit registering."
"I already know what diseases I have with definitive diagnoses. The app didn't even give any of the disorder/diseases I have as an option for my symptoms. Hopefully the app will get better. It needs to ask further questions about the symptoms and what tests have been performed. Hoping this AI will help people like me from waiting years for a diagnosis of a disabling disease. If I would have had treatment sooner, I could have avoided permanent damage to my nerves and organs."
It is very good
Great app
A1! Bang on assesment can't fault it at all
Good app

Its good

very nice app
It was very good. Very helpful.
Not perfect but good dev 3.5 stars
This is my go to app as I have anxiety and get freaked out by health issues easily. Once I talk to Ada my mind is at ease and I know when to go to a doctor and when to stay calm. Absolutely love it!

"Great app, no need to waste lots of time searching Google anymore."
Very helpful
"This is the best, health care. <3"
I'm fully aware it's not a medical diagnosis but it is certainly helpful rather than browsing the web for possible symptoms
Still can get more better. Keep the good work going on.....
Good app

"I absolutely love this app! I have used this a lot, for myself and several other people, and every single time it has turned out correct. I can't think of anything that needs improvement."
Great Symptoms Checker! The must personable symptoms checker without seeing an actual doctor
Helped greatly in focusing on my aches and pains to give me some ideas on what it may be. Good reccomendations.
"Handy app when wanting to track anything. I don't mind answering the questions, as the app needs to figure out what's happening."
Very helpful.
Good app

Very helful
Great app
Spot on
Better than some doctors. Sadly.
"I like this app, very useful for the shy people who cant tell doctors what they suffering ..."
I already had a diagnosis from a professional and just tried Ada out to see if it would match what the docs thought. It did.
"This app helps assess my symptoms and link it to a condition, while also giving the chances of the condition. Really good."
Really great app for medical assesment
Somehow but more things should be added
Helpful and instantly replying on the inquiry
It is good for home checkup and help to know easly the problem
Great spot on info.... makes it easy to explain yourself.

"Ada is the best doctor in my area, It gives you accurately diagonosis"
The best thing I've come across in a long while

Very helpful and useful medical app. Have used it a number of times and has come up with sensible possibilities. Would be better if it included a wider range of answers to maximise choice and a wider possible diagnosis
"excellent, I am happy with the application, it is very good and, in general, it looks reliable, I like it."
Good app to manage your health. Answers on your finger tips.
Good App
I love this app
"Went to the gp with my symptoms that I've had for nearly a year, he gave me no theory of what it is and just gave me pain killers. At least this app gave me a theory which made sense."
I love it this app is Amazin
When it gets to where it reads Just start symptom assesment it goes no farther.
This app is awesome!! It said I have Chronic Lumbarsacral Radiculopathy and I do!! Lol awesome!
Great app!
I can't verify my email. What's wrong?
Satisfied
The best health app ever
Very helpful and ask lots of questions
"Ada can help you understand things that didn't make sense and now I'm keeping my mind open, next time I visit my doctor I'll know what questions to ask. Thanks again"
The app is perfectly ok and it will give u exactly what u want
Great app!
Awesome app!
I have both Fibromyalgia and MECFS. I put in those symptoms to test if this app would pick these two illnesses and it did. Excellent app based on that test.
Actually helpful unlike other fake tests
Great app
Must have. Hands down.
Very good app
Wow this App is so great to have solved my health problem without visitng a doctor
"Ada understands us just like how a doctor does, and it's amazing to have somone or something like this app."
This is app is fantastic. It is almost a real Doctor.
Great
Great
Great idea for an app. I hope they continue to update it as artificial intelligence and computing power gets better.
"Tbh I'm just doing this for fun (I'm ""Hort"", my son's name is ""Fort"", and my wife is ""Dort"") and also to determine if Ada is trustworthy. For the common diagnoses (like PE), Ada was able to get them. Surprisingly, Ada knew about Klinefelter syndrome (though it should have asked about armspan). For the complex diagnoses (like cold agglutinin disease secondary to mycoplasma pneumonia), Ada was clueless but you can't blame it. Overall, Ada seems generally trustworthy in capability"
Very helpful
It helpful
"I must say this app is really, it is able to detect any kind of illness you're suffering from as long as you give good answer to the questions. Well done i must say"
Its very nice and polite and aslo very helpful i like it very much
"This app is very good and helpful. One thing you should improve though: Ask when the problem occurs, like if it's in some specific periods of time and not always. I think that's an important thing to know. E.g. the problem could be in winter or in summer, or maybe after doing a specific activity."
Bang on. Went to Dr and diagnosis was correct
Kinda helpful ease the mind
Ada is great to lean on
"It's so good, the help is amazing"
Fairly accurate but not to be used as a reason to self-medicate. Seeking professional medical assessment is always wise.
"I love this app! I am terrible at remembering when my symtoms occur. It's hard to tell my doctor what date my symtoms started. When I found this app, it was a break though. I can keep track of everything."
I am relieved and consoled by your answer. Thanks
It's relevant
Good idea to create this app.I love it❤️
This app helped me determain if my dad was starting to have a heart attack.
"Positive experience, interesting result. Useful"
"It's the best so far, keep it up. Where possible show some body parts that are being described."
Goood app perfect
Very useful.
It's very thorough and gives you great advice
Very helpful app. Just like a doctor. Kudos to you guys
Great
Wonderful app
Peace of mind
Empowering
good consultation
Very useful. Thank you so much..❤️ Thanks again.
I did many tests and they all seemed accurate to what I had. if you have a health concern this will probably answer correctly
its good to know your symptoms very easy
"It was really helpful to me. Need more available language like Bahasa Indonesia, cause I didn't know too much about medical language in English. Dark mode too."
"Great app. Easy to understand. Love the explanations. The time since onset could be a bit more specific than 'one day to one week'. A symptom that's affected you for a week could be much more troubling than one that's lasted only a day. Not to mention 'one month to one year'. Maybe adding numbered days or weeks to the time of onset? That would be nice. But I have no other complaints. Very wonderful, helpful app. Thank you for this!"
Clear and informative
Very useful now I know what I have
This is a Blessing Application! God bless you guys!
"Why do you heed to give your email to it? Okay, I must have an email to find out why I am suicidal THAT MAKES SENSE"
Great overview of your health.
Ada is really helpfull.It will ask you problems and give you a solution or the reason of your problem.I would like to have more updates.Please add more informations in this app.Thank you.
Very helpful
Hats off to the developer...
This app contains several questions to ask 😂 but it was absolutely helpful for me 👍
Ok. A little frustrating I was given a diagnosis I gave Ada in my first couple of answers
Perfect.
"Docter in my pocket, takes the worrying for nothing out of the equation. No need to search the Web for useless BS. The reports are short and to the point."
Good app. Informative and helpful.
"Actually I have diagnosed with Hypertiroid, and I tried this application just for fun. But it is work !! It describes even more detail. Good job👍"
Great app i love it😁😁😁
Its not an apple that keeps the doctor away... Its Ada :)
Its good.
Great app
This is great👍
Works well as expected.
Can you add more languages like Chinese and Korean? It's hard when I have to translate everything to them. And its also a benefit too.
I honestly love this app
Great app for self analysis of health problems.
This app is very great and very simple to used
Im surprised it works pretty good
Very helpful
Its great but it needs tweeking like it needs question about your environment and needs to be more accurate with what you could have like i checked up on why i was weezing and everything the app only ever came up with one answer and that was asthma but i went to the 24 hour docs closest to me and they said it was not asthma at all but just a small minior infection i was checked for blood clots and asthma just to rule them out but despite the infection im healthy.
Quite worthwhile.
"Very helpful, although it doesn't have everything anything basic it does show you your not dying, unlike Google."
"Top app, very useful"
I think this could make me less anxious when I'm worried about something.
"I am relieved that this application can, at least, say something about my condition.. It was exactly what my doctor said.. I recommend this to everyone ..."
Great
"This app actually really helped me, with depression. I so recommend it."
Awesome app for the first time I've been trying to get a chance
Ada has been so useful to me and I recommend it to everyone
"thanks for this program,to easy and it helped me ,just I hope If it in arabic I hope that"
Great application
Very helpful for determining what's wrong!
"I installed this app and I found theres no options for my symptoms. I typed pain and the area (abdomen, ovaries, etc I tried all sorts of options) funny thing it gave moles as options. Anyway its uninstalled now. I dunno I expected at least a health log/tracker."
Great
It's very useful.
Helpful app must be installed on all mobile phones
Helpful! This app is very useful and accurate. Try it!
Cool
Interesting
One of the best you can open up your symptoms without fearing anything and get results immediately.

"Does what it says and is free, useful for peace of mind whenever I'm unwell"
It's very useful I like it
"Very informative app. It gives you way more infor than other symptom checkers. I'm sticking with this one. It not only tells you possible causes for your symptoms, it gives symptoms for each illness , tells you what symptoms you're missing for a specific illlness, gives prognoses for each diagnosis, treatments, etc, as well. It shows graphs of your symptoms vs a diagnoses symptoms so you can visually compare what you have vs don't have. I just wish it asked for more medical history."
It takes long time but it's extremely helpful! I have been following this for very long now!
Great app...
Very helpful I sincerely wish to recommend this app to everyone out there.
"Wonderful app, very helpful and accurate"
This AP is wonderful! You can include as many symptoms as you need. The other aps and websites I have used limit you to parts of the body and do not allow for specific symptoms. This is the best for getting a good idea of what's going on with your body.
helps a lot more than googling what I have
Very informative and helpful
This app is very helpful I really love it. Take five (5) stars
Very good Ada is now my doctor she/he can treat me very well
Great
They give solution as problem been present
It's really helpful. I love the app
It is a great and helpful app but sometimes is asking me question without not sense and even if I press 'explain to me' is just the same.. and it is another questions that I found it weird even my mom/friends found it really weird...
I have learned something about my health
Great app
Great app
Very helpful app
Good app
The app is of good value as it gives an idea of what the health challenges are. Thanks.
"I can't create an account. Everything stops when I'm at the email verification part. I press on the link I receive but nothing changes in the app; the only possible things to do are either go back or resend the email verification. Please do something about this issue, as I think others have the same problem too!"

Not bad it's helpful

"Great app! Very understandable and gives you the option to read up on what they mean! It was very accurate as I came to it with a sore and ache foot and ankle, my end report said that it would Be best to get some medical attention because from my symptoms it sounded like a fracture, and so I did! And found out I had! Great app and am very happy with it!"
Perfect
Really like this app. Seems to be accurate!
Wonderful and helpful
Very thorough and accurate
A great tool that was able to predict everything an actual medical diagnosis told me
"Too close to exact illness I suppose, I may have prostate problem, thank you"
This is the best thing ever!!! I found out what I actually have I did not see any bugs or glitches. Straight up amazing!
Might be 5 stars if the dr agrees lol
A Very Very Helpful App Bro Thank U Very Very Much Bro

Ada gave a diagnosis I had already been given. Good job.

The report is easy to understand and it's clear ..thank you for your help ada
Very nice app
"Pretty accurate, mabie not 100% however normally the diagnosis from a doc is one out of possibly 4 that the app gives you. It hoves you a chance to figure and get to know your own body temp to help yourself before have to pay a high doc bill in the end. Also helpful if you know your home remedies in advance 😉"

I think it's very useful. It gives a response after asking a series of questions to improve the quality of the results
"My opinion is not definitive because I have only used it once, but Ada accurately confirmed the diagnosis I was given recently by a doctor in 'The Land of Smiles'. Good job. Not only that but there is no sitting in waiting rooms for hours, no extortionate consultancy fees and the app actually speaks a word of English. So reduces the need to pay another doctor for a second opinion. Highly recommended for travellers. 🌐👣⚕️. Peace."
Very thorough and helpful

This app is really reassuring because it gives you advice and tells you if your condition is treatable at home so you know not to waste your doctors time.

Good aspects of this app👍

"As long as you're as honest as possible, it's a good tool. Trouble is you have to then convince your doctor to do necessary tests etc. But when you even mention that an app told you what's wrong with you, the doctor automatically stops listening."

Very helpful
Great app! Pretty much has my symtoms listed with good advice for how to proceed. Tells you if you should contact a doctor. Love it.
"I originally tried this to pass time ... It gave me the exact diagnosis I just received. 7mm kidney stone.. OUCH!! I was also diagnosed with COPD about 2 yrs ago and have asthma. ADA made the exact diagnosis. I am not saying I'd replace this app with a doctor, but i think it can give some piece of mind and help you decide if you need to go to an emergency room."
"Pretty cool app. It diagnoses me with something that my mother had, and I hadn't thought about that at the time Ibwas answering questions. I am surprised it didnt ask for prior trauma (e.g. heart attacks, broken bones, dislocated joints, etc.)."
Very useful
Its not help

This app has really helped 👍

Pretty accurate
At first I was skeptical about this app. I once was diagnosed with Dengue by this app and when I got it checked my blood was negative for Dengue test. Then another few days later I had it checked and then I have Dengue.
Best app for checking symptoms. Good work.
Very useful and informative app. Keep it up
The app has algorithm problems it gets stuck on login screen every damn time
"Not bad, it gives you an idea on how to express yourself to the doctor when explaining what might be wrong"
Gives good and rational advice. Doesn't exaggerate like Google. It's also very accurate.
Ada's very helpful and she helps you get over your insecurities and worries pretty quickly. This is the best health companion ever.
If you're completely honest about your symptoms this app is very helpful.
Perfect! Great app
It's my favourite. Before I see a doctor I first check with Ada. I like it.
Takes too long to get set up. Abandoned set up

Great!
"Pretty good, I like that this generally guides you into what may ail you."
Indepth and thorough
After just a few assessments this seems to be a great app. The questions can be quite extensive but the end assessment so far seems to be spot on.

"The app seems great. But what guarantees me that they keep my info strictly confidential, as it should be, and it will not be shared, so I won't see ""random"" ads (for example, but not limited to) for various pills due to sympoms I said I have?"
Ada did not give me any help with my problem which was a lost tooth and what to keep it in until I can see Dentist in about 3 days

Completely annoying and useless Waist of time
The app keeps asking me to verify my email address upon login but when I click verify on the email they sent to my inbox it says its already verified but I still can't pass through the verification section in your app. The app's algorithm seems busted.
Informative
Awesome app! It has helped me with several problems already. It doesn't diagnose but it gives a few possible diagnoses that could be the problem! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Ada is the best health companion even though it just predict I assure you that you'll get a 98% accuracy if and only if you give it the accurate condition you're in

Loved by me
"It is really a great app , It's very useful to me ."
Put my mind at ease. Thank you.
Good app
"I've long struggled with symptoms sucking out my quality of life. It's been years of medical trial and error. The medical system is a slow one, and symptoms between conditions can greatly overlap. It's a difficult and disheartening journey. Ada allows me to form my own hypotheses that I can bring to my doctor. This allows a more narrowed down search and gives me hope. My biggest gripe is that Ada is sometimes limiting in the answers to the questions it asks. Otherwise invaluable. Thank you, Ada."
The questions were on point
Great app!
Such a nice app. I felt like I was in a real consultation room. Great job
Good..loved the user friendly interactive medium...
Amazing and helpful
Spot on every time!

It's great.
Great job
Great app very helpfull
Very Useful for doctors also 💪👍
Very beneficial every one should be aware of this app
Great site love it
Great when used with care.
"Best symptom tracker out there , I have used Ada for years, since my children were babies and it is accurate and thorough. I like how it gives you 3 possibilities and the level of urgency you need to adopt. I find using this app helps me to decide whether i need to take action or whether i am overeacting, which a lot of people can do, taking up valuavle NHS time and resources."
It was helpful!
we may feel better in Telugu language instead of English
Its helpful app
The results are accurate. After receiving the diagnosis I was checked up by my doctor and the diagnosis are the same. Thank you for making this app!

This is just the best medical app anyone could ask for😍😍
Alright so far
"Very Good App, Self Diagnosis on the basis of symptoms"
"i found this app most usefull, as it analyses briefly all the symptoms. If any common symptoms are missing, it asks by itself."
Very helpful in understanding youy medical condition.
Good to find a answer when you feel bad
Its good
"Better than waiting for a doctor, obviously take results with a pinch of salt. For the most part, they've been extremely accurate for me and 10000 x better than looking on Google"
Very good app gives you insight into medical issues 👌👌
"Super helpful app that can help you diagnose issues, learn more, how to treat, etc."
This app is great. It put my mind at ease and helped me to figure out what might be causing my symptoms.
"While tracking the present symptoms Ada need to consider the patient previous history, if the patient is chronically with diabetes or thyroid, the present latest symptoms might be due to previous illness or side effects of madication."
"Very informative, great idea"
It really helps 👌
The Perfect App
Very helpfull....

Very helpful and informative.
This is the most useful and helpful app I've ever used. Thank you so much for creating an app like this ♥ ♥ ♥
"Just be honest, they will do the rest."
This app is great
Extremely helpful and good at diagnosis
Great app good advice
Very informative never thought of issues raised
"It's a good app. It helps by asking specific questions related to your wellbeing to narrow down the problem. At the end, it lists all possible outcomes (a prognosis). It's better than trying to Google the problem, because it just gives you the worst case scenario lol. Me: ""I have a tingling sensation in my skin"" Google: ""You have skin cancer"" lol. Ada is far better. I wouldn't say it's completely reliable, but it'll give you a rough idea of what the problem is and how to manage. Thanks Ada."
Spot on.
Very straight forward.
It's a very helpful app
this app is so good
Very satisfactory
"¡It's great! It's my helper for any question or concern about my health. It helps me to know FOR REAL the possible diagnosis, it's not like searching on Google or something like that. It's pretty reliable to calm yourself on symptoms that may be not that terrible as you can imagine."
Best health app ever
I love ada. Everytime I feel weird or sick I go straight to ada and it comforts me in a weird way. I love it and honestly if I had to buy it I would. Its amazing.
I love this app very much.Its so reliable.thank you very much.
"What a great app I had sepsis early this year, so I tested ada by putting how i was feeling at that time & it correctly diagnosed sepsis, I wished i had the app then would have gone to the hospital a lot quicker. Great app."
Its so accurate
Very thorough and useful app
Unable to log in or sign up
A very nice app
"I used this app to assess a problem with my knee, it's assessment was proven correct by my doctor a couple weeks later, works great!"
It's really helpful and thorough in questioning great app
"Very informative, thanks to those who invented Ada!"
Good for nothing App... i got stuck on agreeing to terms and conditions.. never Got past that... It's racist too... #BLM
I wasn't able to find my symptoms.
Good app
It saved my life
This app has to be improved more so that it can guide us with better precision.
Very helpful when wNting to get help with symtoms.
Nice health communicational app
Gives good advice
This app gives insights to help you prepare for what the doctor might tell you... It's clearly a rough diagnosis... But certainly helpful.
"The best health app ever,it helps me most of the times."
The best very helpful
Really a good app
Nice app very helpful
It's just my favorite app and helps me a lot during my hard days
Legit and fun. Not five stars though coz the questions are few and the wages for each question aren't quite convincing
Great app
"Best app 😍loved it ,becuse it do not scares like google"
"Doesn't work. Used to work a year ago but now CANNOT do anything. Doesn't respond, deleted app and redownload, same problem. Nothing but junk, a waste of space!"
so good experience almost accurate
Mother is everything for me
It's been astonishingly good..I'm happy with the way the app works
Very supportive..
App crashed at the end of the assessment/questionnaire
"Nice app, most closest first aid."
Very helpful. Loved it.Been using it for many years now and it's been a wonderful health compassion.
Very informative.
Easy 2 answer questions and to understand!
"I would suggest that, if you allow us to type our symptoms for instance I have abdominal pain, exactly after launch, this is not exist in the app"
Definitely spot on and correct with confirming that my symptoms were due to a condition I have had but was a little different then in the past. Confirmed my suspicions. Thank God for this wonderful app.
This app is very useful most importantly for a pregnant woman like me. Thanks Ada!!
Very useful
This is the best health care app i have used!
Works as well as can be expected for such an app. Bravo to the creators; any let downs are likely only due to the limitations of what's possible in this format.
I find this app very useful and very good.. though i would like to have suggestive solutions after the diagnosis of the health complications also...
Isn't always spot on but definitely helps you narrow things down.
Very accurate with potential diagnosis
Very interesting
It's helpful an caring app than ever😍 what I love mostly is how you help us to understand and know everythingabout how we feel thanks a lot for your help❤ keep it up
This app is Appreciable
Looking for something different and had to go through signing up before actually knowing
Very helpful insights to health concerns. Highly accurate too 👍
It results what i am going through ... And that is amazing !!
this is a really helpful app to be honest its better than i expected.😁
Questions about your symptoms are thorough
This is extremely thorough and detailed. I underestimated this app. Keep up the great work guys! 🤘
Very good easy to read and understand
perfectly good app
Great
Gave a lot of good different symptoms and put them all together and gave me a list of highly to not likely causes one of the best symptom apps
Very useful app. Would recommend it for specific symptoms.
"This system was very helpful,"
It is superb..i love it
"This app is honestly amazing. Whenever I feel sick or my family feels sick, and we dont know what is going on, I immediately pull out Ada and nine times out of ten Ada is correct. I am not one to comment or rate my apps but Ada deserves 5 star rating. Anything from a common cold to women's issues to an injury, Ada usually has the answer. I LOVE THIS APP."
Asks great questions to find my health problem
I liked the idea it has the potential to greatly benefit the medical domain
Very helpful
This is perfecr app. Help me much to see my health problems and to analyse them by adding some symptoms that I though they are not interesting.
I love this app. It's very Insightful and helpful and there are no ads.
Very good and helpful
Ada is one af my favorite app because that is very helpfull for every time ...
Very thorough!
Why do I need an account?
The best of the best.
It's a nice experience
I am a Pharmacist-cum-Nutritionist. Ada helps me a lot in day to day counseling. It's q very concise app. I think it can be more conclusive by keeping it's questionnaire small and precise.
App is good but after updation i could login to it!
This app is very helpful
It is very good
Great app!!!!
It is amazing how much it figured out with my symptoms and the diagnosis matched the MRI and physiology doctors. Have more conditions waiting to be diagnosed and it put same ones my doctor said I wonder if that's how they know. It's still Kool af
Accurate thats why 5 stars
Terrible app. Kept skipping from something I was doing to something else. Very general questions. Not very intelligent.
Very helpful
Very accurate app after several uses of it
Satisfied!
Very helpful 😊
"Ada is excellent help, you just have to be honest."
Great
This app helps people to be conscious about their health... that's great!
Very helpful
I think ada should be more specific.... The list of possible conditions for one's symptoms are too many and too confusing
Just amazing wow
Very helpful
It is good and helpfull app keep it up
Pretty good really helpful app
"Best health assessment application ever. Questions are asked in very simple language. Give accurate results. Hats off to the Developers, Researchers and Medical team."
Good app
Really good!!!
really good accurate and thorough app!
"I installed this app because it came up when I typed ""oxygen level tester"". This ago doesn't check your oxygen level. It is a symptom analysis. Like ""web MD "". So I installed. DUH!"
The opinion expressed by Ada is consistent with what a non medical friend told me
Great for using before going to the medic
It's a nice app. And it accurate
Very helpful
i like the app. it doesn't have problem loading.kudos. it helps the individual to know different diseases with same symptoms. is a very good app for health practitioners and students. i recommend it.
Almost always it's report based on your symptoms is spot on. Follow up questions aren't exhaustive or at times none of the options may be correct but still you can't downplay it's performance based on that. My goto app. Keep it up guys
Helps to know more medical term to your symptom & clearly know some medical terms before seek doctor
"This is a great app to try and figure out what you could possibly have, and not get cancer or death as the first result. However you do need to be honest, and specific with the symptoms you are entering to get a semi accurate guess as to what is going on with who ever you are searching for. There is also a feature where you can track whatever symptom you wish to track."
It actually good
My health and that of my family is in good hands.
Very nice app. It gives you a good diagnoses of what the ailment might be.
Been using this app for a long time now and it's very helpful. Thank youu.
This is the best app ever.
"Very efficient, accurate and reliable. I would recommend it to every single person. You'll never be disappointed with it"
Great
Doesn't work anymore was useful before
"Reasonable symptom checker, however I downloaded the app hoping that it would be able to measure my heart rate, similar to the way that the Samsung Health app did on my old Samsung galaxy note 4. The old app would do this by placing my finger over a sensor on the back of the phone. This Ada app asks you to describe your symptoms using a series of questions, and will then give possible causes for the symptoms you list."
I really like It! It lets me know if there may be something wrong so I don't have to see the doctor. Not to mention it's free!
Amazing. If you live in a third world country you need this
"Useful... If it's accurate. The needlessly repetitive questions bother me a lot though. Instead of asking questions like ""Do you have X in Body Part Y?"", ""Do you have X in Body Part Z?"" in succession, just ask ""Do you have X anywhere on your body?"" and if the user answers ""No"", there's no reason to ask about all the body parts! If they answer ""Yes"" just let them select the body parts."
Cool
"i call this the paranoia app, it tells me i might be bipolar, i dont wanna be bipolar.:("
"Pretty legit app. The only request is there should be more options to select other than. (Yes, No, I don't know) Like maybe: (Sometimes, comes and goes, constantly, & rarely)"
Great app
Very helpful ♥️
This is very helpful and i love the way it is simplified in accessing symptoms
This app is perfect and never wrong
Very useful app!
Really great app very helpful
Very usefull in case you dont have any hint about whats causing your symptoms
"Glitch, couldnt get past the start up screen. I click continue and nothing happens"
On point for the most part with assessments or pretty close if not..
Very good App and very helpful in providing me with answers to what is possibly wrong. Very happy with this App.
It seems excellent. It diagnosed me the same diagnosis I got from GP. And provided correct method they used for complicated diagnosis I highly recommend this app. I would say absolutely brilliant
Helpful to some extent
Amazing! Very helpful
"Ada is Simply awesome app, though she ask many questions but in the end she analyzes possible problems and offers advice, love it."
Very helpful
It's very interesting
"Does the trick, i love it"
A very helpful app before the doctor arrives.
Great app. Has detected things that doctors confirmed later through lab tests. I trust it.
A great app indeed
It's good
Excellent way to sort your thoughts before GP consultation
It help a lot. Thanks Ada.
"Good app ever, it's helping me to know my health status"
Very helpful
"Very detailed when it comes to questions, depending on your problem. To be honest, this helped me a lot and made me think if I should be worried or not."
it helps you with all problems😍😍
It is very useful
Its really good tho id like it even more if the app gave you tips on how you can make yourself feel a little better
Like this app easy to listen too
"Mostly a good app, tends to be pretty accurate and gives good health readings. One thing I would like to note is that this app is not going to be accurate for transgender people who have undergone any form of HRT and/or gender affirming surgeries. I say this as it asks you to choose your sex, not your gender, but asks no further questions. My sex is female, but I am taking testosterone and I have no breasts. Therefore it can't give accurate readings on sex related problems."
Great app
You can try this normally to check your condition. I just tried casually came to know about my health condition.
Not working in Sudan without VPN
Not responding while signing up!!
really helps you and gives you an idea of what is going on.
Quite informative.
Why whenever i try signing up you tell me incorrect email/password combination?

So thankful for this app this could of been one of them saved his life apps. Thank you again.
Great job!
Fast and easy ..just a few specific questions answered and then the results of the probable reasons for your symptoms...with a detailed explanation of each possiblity.
"Very nice app thank you keep it up,app not to miss in your mobile phone people"
It's really good.. Since I am a medical student it actually diagnose the disease correctly often it's good app
This a great app
I think that the descriptions of each question (such as: pain felt in he inside of the knee) I don't really understand this
Amazing quick and easy
Ada is very good and useful app....Just download and see 👀..... This improve very helpful for me...
It's really a very nice app. that assist to find the root of any medical ailments for medical treatment. Tumbs up for the developer of this great application.
Thank you Ada keep up the good work it's very helpful app
Very good and helpful.
Extremely reliable and helpful.
Helped get the correct medical care
"I love ittt,,,, every family needs this. It saves me the trip to the doctor"
"Pretty good, it just is hard to get it to understand there's pre-existing health issues"
An absolute gem created by the developers. Been using it for a long.
Really great app. Obviously not a substitute for doctor but doesn't claim to be. Has correctly identified the cause of my symptoms many times. Really love this app. Nice user interface and good way to keep track of your health as well.
Very helpful
very useful app
This app accurately diagnosed my dengue when my doctor couldn't. It has helped me a lot. Most reliable medical app.
Really helpful this should be something that you be a priority on every person's phone.
"I've been searching for this app for a long time. Thank you so much. Can you find a way to stop asking to rate your app, once one had already done it?"
"The diagnosis put my mind at ease, it's like I was live before my doctor! Kudos to the ingenuity of the developers; you have my full 🌟 🌟 🌟🌟🌟"
"Helpful, very nice"
Love this app it's been so helpful
Will change your life
This app correctly diagnosed an issue that took doctors five years to diagnose..and they misdiagnosed me with cancer for six months along the way.
Very useful
I give it five stars! I've been bothered by nasty stomach illness I caught while fishing and I've been trying to heal it with eating only the porridge and tea for three days but it doesn't seem to go away. Ada listed me some illnesses and all of them go away without treatment. Goodbye porridge hello hamburgers.
Very helpful. I love it
It's the best health app
"Because I entered a lot of the health symptoms my body is going through, the app mainly focused on ""Depression."" If you are a woman going through menopause there is only one option ""bleeding."" You are not given other choices like ""hot flashes,"" ""weight gain,"" etc. Although on a few questions you can click on ""explain more"" which may or may not help you answer. One question let me write in my own answer to ""appetite"" I feel this app will best help others who's health issues are in isolated areas."
Very useful
A very helpful health app in times of doubt about what one is feeling and what the Medics actually finds.
"Very usefull, would recommend"
Think you are the best ever
so helpful for real
Love this app. It has been very useful and helpful in diagnosis and been correct and accurate.
Extremely Satisfied 😌
Ada helped me out and she her services are amazing and it doesn't even require money! You should definitely get it
Keep up the good work!
Normally quite helpful but it won't let me update my profile to say I'm currently pregnant. No option to save and keeps reverting back to not pregnant
good... sorry... excellent 👍 . I am very dependent on it. Thanks
"Ada separated my symptoms and streamlined the causes. Identifying the source accurately. With multiple issues, I have been unable to focus on one area. Ada's recommendation made me immediate action."
Very helpful
Perfect... Just perfect
Excellent but too many steps to install fully
Beautiful app it's a like therapy session. Keep up the good work 👌
Very helpful.... So perfect.
"incredible, I love it , it helps me every day ❤ it's a really good app and it's easy to sign in too , definitely install this app ❤"
Really good app. Helps me find professional ways of treatment at home during these Corona times.
this app is VERY helpful!!
Doesn't work and can be dangerous.
Ada has been mine and my kids' on-the-go doctor. It's been very helpful and I recommend it for everyone.
"The app is useful, helpful and accurate. I love it!"
Spot on with my diagnosis...I would install this app and keep it for when you need it.its like having a doctor in your pocket.
It's awesome
"A few times I've found the possible outcomes inaccurate. Still, it was tremendously helpful in the sense that it helped me to know exactly what to say to the doctor prior to the appointment by taking notice of other symptoms I wouldn't have thought of otherwise."
Nice app with mostly accurate results. Wish it had night mode too.
The app did its job giving me an assumption of what it might be until I can go to the doctor
Great
Signed up then wouldn't accept my password 2 minutes later uninstalled
I dont rate apps but this one is really helpful so they deserve this rating. 😊
Absouelty SCRUMPTIOUSSSSSSSSSSS
Really annoying that you have to pay. The NHS should make an app like this
Good! Same result as the doctor gave me
highly helpful. coz v get an idea wt d problem can b .I helped me a lot
Thanks for this vocation
much  needed app
Very easy and efficient! Would recommend!
Very helpful
"I love this app, it's 90% accurate"
One of the best applications i have ever used.
"This app has helped me through a lot of times when I feel ill becuase it makes me feel better knowing what's going on, most if the time it's a panic attack which I now see is true because it gives you options of a list of 1 to 5 of what it could possibly be."
Perfect
Awesome App this is going to help alot
Very dependable and reliable companion❤
Great
"I'm glad that this app also shows you psychiatric conditions. I frequently got severe depression as a result, and sometimes bipolar. Kinda scares the daylight out of me but I'll be seeing a psychiatrist ASAP 😅"
"Very friendly app,fantastic and understandable,always there for you"
It's an informative tool that seems to narrow down an illness.
Cool
Its awsumn
Great app and so helpful
"Very accurate and detailed, with a simple, straightforward interface. Helpful first step for people hesitant to visit doctors straight away."
Love it. Helpful enough to give u a general idea what your possibly dealing with. Handy to have on ur phone for quick checks.
Quick great straight forward questions. I love it. Life saver
"So I've been feeling pain so I went through the app and it asks ""Are your joints stiff in the morning and does the stiffness get better after some time?"" and since this is a two sided question I don't know how to answer. I might be the problem though"
Just cool
Incredible diagnostic tool/symptom checker
"Very helpful and intuitive app ! 🙂 It's as if one has a doctor next to them, though the app can't replace a specialist's advice and diagnosis !! It's nice to have an idea, before one makes out assumptions of not being well, although not knowledgeable. People often get anxious, especially in this day and age, with a pandemic around the world, and it's highly likely they may panic with all this rumour of COVID-19 symptoms and stuff 😷!!! God forbid !!!🙂👍✌"
Better than expected
It exceptional and I think their option is too short they should give us the chances to explain further
"It's really a wonderful app, it helps out alot Everybody should have it already.."
Very helpful
Very good app
Love it pretty accurate
Pretty good at assessing your symptoms
"This app is great. My daughter used it to put in her P.O.T.S. symptoms and the app actually suggested that as a possibility. P.O.T.S is rarely identified correctly by doctors so that was impressive! (She does have the condition). I've used it many times over the last 2 years and always found it informative, accurate and helpful!"
Spot on
Really good. I'm glad I downloaded this.
Please put the images for all the questions
A very good app... eases the mind for body cases.... also give meantime solutions to your cases and tells you when to go to the doctor. Great app! User friendly! I love it.
Having Ada in your phone is same as having a wife who is doctor
"I can't log in to my older account or make a new one.after set my password ,app doesnt work"
This app is help it is so fast on giving answer i real like it
Great app on figuring out what symptoms u may have
It's great!
This helped out alot for what the questions i was asking it sumed it all up.

"It's an good app, because I got an good report from Ada"
Good and helpful app
Very interesting and gave me the possibility of an intestinal parasite for an ongoing mild bladder infections that no doctor had ever suggested (and I've asked a few). So going to get that checked out. 👍
"Undoubtely, this app is one of the best in medical research as it give deep prescriptions of your health."
"Excellent application, go ahead give it a try"
Very Usefull
Doesnt give you the scary conditions Google does when u type in your pains ect much better
Really helpful if you keep getting random symptoms
I like this app
This app was on point with my symptoms.

It was good and very helpful for every person who are experiencing this kind of health problem
Thank you
"Very nice app.. Very helpfull, keep on the good work"
This app is really amazing it assesed me and gave me a list of possible illnesses. It is really useful Get it and thank me later
"It helps me to check for possible symptoms, not just the most bugging ones and analyze the most likely cause. Very exhaustive and relevant in the list of symptoms."
Perfect
"It helps me a lot in determining initial diagnosis of any symptoms and surprisingly most of them were accurate. Usually when I google them, it is oftem exaggerated and only made me nervous and anxious."
"I know it's bot, but giving 5 stars Because helping so much"
Still in the nascent stage
Good app
It's a good app and easy to understand
Great app has a wide range of symptoms to choose from unlike other apps
Gives me a good understanding of what I may have.
It's great!
Really extremely awesome
Very helpful application
Very informative. The animation and transition speed is a bit too slow to my liking - I hope there's an option of disabling animations.
Very Good app for detecting possible diseases using symptoms
Great app
Very good app

"Very helpful app, I truly recommend it"
Very helpfull
Very Helpfull
It was Its correct I do have fibromyalgia
I'm really overwhelmed by the resolution and suggestions given by this application. It really help out like for very first consultation tool. Thanks for the team who make it.
Very good app.
It's OK
great app
"She's useful because if you can't go to the GP or you have a sudden pain and you're not close to a medical place, you could describe your symptoms and and she would give you a list of diagnosis that link to your symptoms. It wouldn't mean you have any that but she would see what is closes and then you could find a medication as she has given you her assessment. (It also might help as if you did have that, you could see a GP or hospital and get a prescribed medication or treatment)."
"This is a really cool idea. It is not perfect of course, but I can see how it could be helpful in certain situations"
People should make more apps like this. Amazing minimalistic experience with respect to app usage & diagnostics. A must have.
I was amazed at how thorough this app is. Very helpful!
"The app is very useful, helps a lot in identifying different medical issues, and filter the what is wrong and what's not"
Great app
"Good app, im not able to find for send the report to doctors"
Good one
"Very helpful app, without single ad (at least on my end). It feels like you're consulting to a doctor directly which is based on intuitive questions."
Very Helpful
It helps alot
"It's brilliant, simply brilliant"
Love this App!
The best online health helping app
"Better than any MD that I know! And I DO KNOW THEM A LOT, and a lot of them, I tried to become one for more than 10 years..."
I have no complaints. They always answer my questions so I'm thankful
this app is amazing i totally recommend that you get this app
This app actually detected a illness that my Dr struggled to detect... Fully recommend

One of the best app
"This is a great app, but the UI needs a little work. Don't let that stop you from getting it though!"
A very good app
I found it very easy and helpful
Very helpful. Would recommend
Just great !
"Awesome, using for about a year and it's perfect. Best all ever. I'm a 100% fan, lover, Ada is the best."
Very good app
very good App. trying to compare with clinician advise on 5 people and it was similar
Very crucial application
It's very help full
It's an excellent tool to help ourselves during the Covid 19 pandemic
Very useful app
Its very helpful!!
Surprisingly very good the app gave me the exact diagnosis that actually have been diagnosed in 2018.
"it is accurate, useful and can help in emergency or in case of no doctors"
Good! Definitely mostly for acute symptoms and not chronic.
It's a great app
Excellent application. It is helping in diagonosys of illness by symptoms. Also for learning.
Best app ever.. I gotta say if u want to discover ur illness.. I guess u should concert ada... It's very helpful

Wonderful app

"I'm really glad when I using this app, it's grate and useful thanks developers and mighty God easy your way to help more people who are in need."
"Love it, helpful"
still better than public healthcare:)
Great app!
Helpful app thank you.
"Ada first, Doctor second Easy and on point❤️"
It is the best app its very helpful
Very useful
thanks Ada for help.
Pretty accurate
"This app is so good, it's uncanny. The questions asked are insightful. And it gave me the same suggested condition that a doctor had diagnosed me with earlier in the week."
Great.
Swahili language should be important addittion on this app
Like consulting a medical practitioner physically! Real good!
"Helpful and accurate. Sometimes the pics don't load, otherwise perfect ♥️"
Works great seems very accurate.
Great on point
"Even though it's not an accurate medical report, it gives you a clearer idea of what you might have and helps you to be able to explain to a professional medical practitioner."
"Honestly, to have a tool this good and accurate for free is just unbelievable. Especially living in Germany, where it can easily take weeks of calling every day just for your GP to answer the phone, then to deal with super-impolite staff and cross your fingers that the doctor will even bother listening to you."
Good to know about the instant health care.
Great app
This is good
detailed questioning and gave some logical advice
Great feedback
"Ada has been very helpful to me each time I have any issues with my health. The recommendations are always straight to getting my health challenge solved. However there is room for improvement. I have been following and using the app and each time i have cause to change my mobile phone, I usually download the app so as not to have any gap with the app. I have recommended the same app to many of my friends who are of same age bracket and who need to watch out for their health just like I do"
Very helpful
Excellent app. Very helpful.
This app is very helpful
Great app!
Awesome app that shows possible conditions from your symptoms in a beautiful and simple interface.
Very helpfull.
"Love the app, wish to have it in Arabic as well"
Helped me a lot
One of the best apps I've come across. I believe such a program will make a huge difference in the health sector in the future. Revolutionary. Such an amazing app. Thank you Ada.
I have used it more than a year and it's helpful.☺
Best of the best experiences it delivers.. Grateful for the dev team
Good app
"Always a good Bot to hand, great app."
Best of the health/condition-diagnosis apps I've tried. (Next best is probably the Babylon health app)
I love this app
Better than most Nigerian Physicians
Used it for the 1st time this morning and it appears to be good so far 👍
Very helpful in times of emergency cases
Ada help me on cough
Great app
"Haven't seen a single ad in my year of using it. It's like having a doctor in your pocket but there's no need for money or insurance, it it 100% free."
The user experience is designed to help the users get on average accurate health reports. In my case I was validating the results with my case. I totally recommend this app for everyone. It provides you with an initial results prior to taking a medical advice from your physician.
Very helpful! More so than the doctor's receptionist!
Very helpful I managed to get help for something quite serious
"Mostly it diagnoses correctly, still need doctor's consultation. But for a quick reviews of your current condition this is helpful."
It gives you the knowledge of a doctor and let you decide what to do on your own responsibility.
Very helpful
Very good app
ur the best
Consulted this app everytime i feel something and can put my mind at ease if it is just a minor blister. And once i tried to check whats going on with my hand. It says i possibly have a carpal tunnel syndrome and was adviced to go to the doctor. I went to the doctor and got my carpal tunnel surgery. I really love this app.
"Wow! I am truly amazed by this app. Everybody should download this app, at least to get a good insight about your health. I strongly recommend it ."
I used it last year . Great app. Now it has improved a lot.
"I just faked an illness and by running the diagnosis it resulted to the same illness i faked. And even better,gives you full info about such disease. WELLDONE!!!"
Very helpful
Very Good App
Beautiful App. The sypmtoms presented are sureal. Makes me want to rule out seeibg the doctor but no......All the best guys.
Sound advice
good apps for early advice
After mulitple attempts it still won't send me am email to verify my account and there is no way to contact Ada through the app without being signed in. Checked all my inboxes and no email. Update...u did actually get several emails the next day. It would be nice to have a confirmation screen. Otherwise cool app
It's is been helpful to me as a person
Splendid working with ada
"Not even able to sign up. Initially they don't send you the email verification link despite 50 clicks. And when they do, it doesn't work. Poorly designed and looked after app. Not recommended."
Only used a couple of times for myself and a few times playing around and I have to say it's quite effective 😁
Very useful
"I learned so much about myself, it is helping me understand what i am going through."
I love that the language is very clear
This app is pretty nice but don't rely on it go get a real doctor Please 👍
Mini Doctor at hand So helpful..
It's a great app
"Really great app, inspects symptoms well. Even asks if you have suicidal thoughts and tell you how to get out if you answer yes. Overall, great app."
Great app
Very helpful
Being able to get an idea of what could be the problem is amazing.
Amazingly accurate
"It helps me, it gave a good suggestion about the illness. It has no much questions but it is almost there."
It helped me a lot
Not able to install the app.. Tried 6-7 times.. After 60-63% it stopped installing
Excellent app. Really user friendly
Great
