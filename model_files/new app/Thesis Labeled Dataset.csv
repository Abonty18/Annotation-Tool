9,My account says it’s been temporarily locked. I didn’t do anything to violate the rules against the app and when I’ve tried making a new account to use that one to contact my friends and family that account gets deleted as well. The app was working so well but it seems like there’s an update that was done that’s giving everyone this issue. I’ve tried contacting Snapchat’s support team as well and it was no use only to receive a page being told how this could of happened. It’s been 24 hours now and there is still no change at all. All of my memories are on that app from 2014 and now it’s all gone like that without even a notice. Snapchat please make a solution to this issue it’s ridiculous that we have to worry about not being able to access our personal information from this app. And please make a customer service phone number because trying to contact you guys is so darn difficult it’s not easy and it shouldn’t have to be that way. I’m sure many people can agree with me we need the app to be fixed as soon as possible !,abunomanhaider@iut-dhaka.edu,3,labibahhoque@iut-dhaka.edu,3,rifahramisa@iut-dhaka.edu,2,3,Partially Correct,3

878,Over a week ago there was a change in Facebook reels that I use for my personal account but most importantly for my business account to gain more followers and business. When I go to make a reel on either page and I go to click on music there is no longer a bar to adjust music and video audio like before! So I get all music and when I remove it my video audio is no longer there as well! I wrote Facebook well over a week ago and nothing has been done to fix this issue that I rely on for my business!!! On Instagram I have no problem on my business or personal accounts and post reels with ease there. Facebook just keeps going backwards and will eventually fall way behind to other social media platforms. Because they will not fix issues such as extremely important ones like this for small businesses to promote their videos and content for clients and future clients!

1469,"This communist run company steals our data then sells it. They arbitrarily remove people’s content, property, creations, memories, etc. all if they disagree with person who has the account. They hate and censor conservatives. They push fake “vaccines” that don’t work and censor any information that dares to criticize them of anything on the left. Meanwhile they are fine with Holocaust Denial content. Where are the disclaimers for that? And content that incites is Islamic terror and the murder of Jews. That is OK with Facebook! But God forbid we question the “vaccines” that don’t even work and may even be dangerous. It is an extreme leftist company/cult. Its employees are cult members. Zuck is an entitled weirdo. So was his sister. One of these days I’m going to drive up to Dobbs Fairy and tell Mark’s parents what a horrible kid they brought into the world. He/his company has arbitrarily destroyed about 50% of my activist work I was doing on the platform. They’ve destroyed many of accounts and groups. Without valid reason. They’ve been doing it to me since I joined the platform. The company is intolerant of facts, history, logic, ethics, or morals. On top of all that they steal your data and sell it to others for profit. Lastly I experimented with their “advertising” where you pay to either help build a page or promote posts. I experimented with this once to get new follows. I directed my ad toward only people who work in a certain industry in NYC. I only got a few new follows. From fake accounts outside of the USA. I of course couldn’t get a hold of anyone to get a refund. Facebook offers no valid customary support. Because they don’t view as humans or customers. We are product/data to them. They are a highly inhumane and unethical company. God willing they will be destroyed soon once everyone wakes up. And Zuck belongs in prison. The company should be fined and regulated out of business. They’ve arbitrarily destroyed so much of my personal property/ideas/memories that I shared on the platform all because they didn’t agree with it. Because the company is extreme left wing and I happen to be on the right. Now they do this in bulk. Millions of conservatives/republicans are censored. Accounts and pages destroyed or don’t reach enough people as Facebook has algorithms to silence conservatives/republicans. I work hard to use Facebook and their other products very little. And I try to delete them off my phone. But they make their apps purposely to be addictive. Which is also evil. They don’t care one iota about anyone who uses the platform, especially if you are on the right politically. Zuck runs his company like a totalitarian dictatorship and basic free speech that the regime doesn’t like is censored or doesn’t react many people. Once they label you as an effective conservative activist both you and your pages are at risk. Best for right wingers to fully get away from leftist big tech. They hate us. They censor us. They destroy our work. And our accounts. Never for valid reasons. It’s just because they don’t like our views. In short they are actually a fascist company. And shouldn’t even exist anymore in the USA as they don’t meet the standards or LAWS of this country. They put up misinformation disclaimers to support all the leftist narratives. But they don’t even take down Holocaust Denial content or put any disclaimers on it. As I’m addicted to FB and IG since they literally built them to be addictive, it’s difficult for me to not be active on the platforms. But I’m trying. I suggest anyone who values free speech but who is against real hate speech, and incitement of violence, to do the same. Especially if you are on the right. There will become a loony most leftists will realize these things too, as Facebook again is an extremist left wing company in and of itself. So moderate or centrist leftists will eventfully be censored/silenced too. Facecook’s agenda is to steal and sell your data, profiting off of you. But if they don’t like your views (which do not break Facebook’s terms) and you’re an effective online activist, they will do the things I mentioned above. Everyone who has ever had their accounts or pages wrongly destroyed by Facebook should create/join a global class action suit against the company. Also what sort of “company” has zero real customer service? There are no real humans that work at Facebook. Just brainwashed cult followers. No real humanity there. They don’t care about the people they mess with and hurt, especially if they disagree with you. The company is not fair or even handed. They are pure evil and they company should be destroyed. Zuck who is a fascist tyrant should be fined out of existence. And then imprisoned for life. Everything I’ve said applies to the majority of not all the leftist Big Tech companies, even Apple. They don’t treat their customers right. And if they dislike your views you are not a human being to them.

All while making BILLIONS as they collect and sell every bit of personal information you provide. You’re literally just a human battery in the Matrix when you use Facebook. And free speech on the platform is highly suppressed. They’re too busy catering to their “woke” agenda.

3357,"I keep having issues where the same 5 people I always tag in stuff (on public pages), their name will just completely stop popping up when I go to tag them. Every other random person on my timeline will pop up to tag, but not my close friends. I keep reporting the issue and it will get fixed for a little bit but then it will happen again. 

Also the ads are out of control, scammers on every major page trying to get people to message them and click on links or send them money, TONS of fake pages selling fake products that you will never receive or it will be completely wrong. Most of those pages are Chinese. I keep reporting them but they are never ending.

I hate getting notifications for random friends going live. I didn’t ask to be notified about it so idk why I keep getting them. 

Everytime Im on the Facebook market, I change the filter to show ONLY local items but I STILL see advertisements for online purchases, and people selling stuff across the country. Trying to find something local is much harder due to all of the irrelevant stuff Facebook allows to be posted in the market, even with the location filters being applied. I tried to sell some purses and Facebook didn’t allow my post because they said I could be selling fake name-brand items. Which they weren’t fake so how are you going to delete my post just because they “might” be fake without any proof to back it up. Facebook has no problem allowing fake pages to sell fake items all over the place but draw the line at someone trying to get purge some purses from their closet?

Your policies say you don’t allow nudity or stuff that is sexual in nature but when I report it, you say it doesn’t go against community standards. Why have it as an option to click on when someone reports something then? Facebook has no problem showing nude images of Melania Trump but let’s see how fast they take down nude images of someone else. They also have no issue allowing nude and sexual images posted on people’s pages promoting their onlyfans. If I wanted to see onlyfans-type content, I would get an onlyfans. 

 Also, I think it’s funny that Facebook fact-checks anything that is speaking against liberals/democrats etc, but I’ve NEVER seen a fact check for any false information spread about conservatives. It’s so blatantly biased at this point. You could even post a direct quote or video and they’ll fact check it saying it’s “out of context”, but yet don’t point out the lacking context for anything speaking against conservatives. I don’t appreciate the obvious political bias on social media and the constant censorship. You can’t post ANYTHING now without being censored. Even if it’s very mild in nature. They suppress any page that they don’t want people to see if they don’t agree with it. So even if they don’t take your post down or fact-check it, they will make it so that not as many people will have it appear on their timeline. It’s disgusting how much they control what information is reaching people and the obvious agenda they are pushing.  JUST STOP. I don’t care what party anyone supports, just show it all fairly across the board and let the people decide for themselves. 

I keep hitting the “hide” option for COVID information posts from Facebook and yet I keep seeing them and have it shoved down my throat. 

Also, I changed my settings so that Facebook couldn’t collect data from past searches to help them target their ads, but yet I could talk about something at my house or buy something at Walmart and next thing I know, Facebook is bombarding me with ads on the SAME EXACT item that I was just talking about. 

I keep Facebook to keep up with friends and family far away and so that they can keep up with me, if that wasn’t the case, I would’ve deleted it long ago.

Also, while scrolling, it’s WAY too easy to accidentally swipe a little teeny tiny bit too much to the right, which takes you back to the previous page, and you lose your place and have to start all the way back at the top of the way-too-long list of items (that would’ve been much shorter had the sub-categories still been available).
And the search?  Forget about it.  I can search a keyword (e.g. “mirror”) with the local filter on and about half the time I’ll get like 8 listings, then about 10,000 listings show up below under “Results Outside Your Search” even though a good portion of those items should have been within my search (e.g. a bunch of mirrors that are definitely local to me mixed in with non-local items).  
AND— half the time it includes a bunch of stuff WITH my search results that are NOT related (I just search credenza and got a whole bunch of listings for dressers that don’t even mention the word credenza).
I thought maybe it was a fluke/clash with iOS version/etc, so I updated the app and even tried uninstalling/reinstalling FB— but no, still woefully effed up.

ALSO, the functionality for those wishing to offer shipping is a joke, which has led a lot of people to either make mistakes about whether they’re able to ship items (huge items that— as someone who owns a business selling online, I know this very well— would cost more to ship than the price they’re asking for the item itself) or use workarounds that lead to their items showing up in my feed even though there’s no way they could ever send those items to me (especially via USPS).
It’s pretty frustrating that FB doesn’t even say anything about box sizes (or types... like using a Priority Mail box) and you’re left guessing as to what to do if your package is a couple ounces over.
Rather than going into too many details on what FB needs to offer to its sellers (shipping), I suggest the developers do a bit more digging into the functionality of other online selling platforms, or partner with a company that handles these logistics all the time.  I get wanting to keep it simple, but at least offering the option of using more precise tools would be a game-changer.",hasinmahtab@iut-dhaka.edu,3,shahriarkhan@iut-dhaka.edu,3,saadmansakib@iut-dhaka.edu,1,3,Partially Correct,3

For example, tonight I received a reply to a post asking me how I was doing. I checked the profile. The picture was that of an American Army general. I don’t know any Army generals. I blocked him rather than report it because I knew that would be useless. Unfortunately these people are scammers and prey on women mostly.

10762,"Deleted the app and profile. After having a profile for 15 years, I decided to move on and away from the political nonsense I had to see from friends and family about national and international issues that had nothing to do with them on a daily basis. 

I was also tired of the constant push for assurance from people to feel a certain way about everything. It started to feel like a forum in a way. Like if you didn’t agree with a majority of people you would find yourself arguing with strangers who don’t know your life. It started to feel a little too cliquey for me. 

For the first few years it was fun. Coming from MySpace with the fun and keep in touch attitude, it was easy to connect with friends, family and coworkers alike. In my opinion, after everyone’s parents and even grandparents got on it, it was nothing but annoying and still is to this day.  I don’t wanna look forward to radically charged political opinions every 2-4 years in my face telling me what I need to do and try to persuade me to think a certain way to benefit others and not myself. It was like watching the news everyday but it never gets better. 

As for friends. All people do these days are spy on you and stalk you online but avoid you in a grocery store or act weird in person. Nobody is really authentic in person anymore because of online social medias. People would rather receive likes and attention over real friendship and it’s easy to see that on Facebook. 

Also the Ads were the most annoying experience. I know they keep it free but they turn around and sell all your information and you get more ads in your email and other Facebook owned apps. I literally had to delete and select no to a list of things when I deleted my profile and I’m glad I did. 

Another little thing that bothered me was accidentally seeing spoiler alerts I would get from pop culture fan pages about a big movie I wanted to see or a simple meme a friend would share and ruin it for me. So unnecessary.

It became a very exciting place because I got to learn about the world and discuss topics and even started my own study group which now has been taken down. 

I have been suspended permanently and banned off of the platform because I showed many things that were true that they did not like. They being Facebook. 

Facebook has become a spy op big brother just like 1984 warned us about. They have censored peoples views and stopped people expressing themselves and are controlling the rhetoric and dialogue of freedom speaking Americans right here in the San Francisco Bay area of all places! 

They are a disgusting operation run by horrible people who are bent on their own explicit agenda and not one ounce of true American values anymore. 

 I lost three business pages many groups which I had started of up to 5000 people and counting and was removed off of the platform without any choice or recourse and so were many of my friends just because we backed President Trump.  

All of my studies for five years disappeared and were hidden by their so-called fact checkers who are just not the implants and part of the controlling of free speech.  

The Nuremberg code needs to be implemented on this nefarious bunch immediately! 

 They are CCP and infiltrated the United States and have waged a crew on the US government with a false president and hacking our election. 

Twitter is in on it too and these two should be strung up by their toenails pronto. And my American friends are sick to death of this infiltration of the American dream. 

They are international criminals and have waged war on the world through their platform and we are not going to put up with it anymore.

Not to mention I have reported multiple stalkers who like stuff on my page from years ago and spam me, message me and go through and find my friends adding them only to be able to add me!!! I report it and FACEBOOK. Says that isnt against community Guidelines  but posting jokes and my business is???? 

These people stalk me due to me being a amputee and they are “sexually” turned on by it so they non-stop harass me but y'all are worried about my posts?!?! 

What a joke. 12 years and in one year i got 4 different reports for jokes and wording something wrong… not to mention all the glitches the app has and all the issues ive had lately

Whoever hacked my account purchased something and it was withdrawn from my bank account through PayPal. This happened after my account was hacked and had already been reported, to pay for something the hackers got from Facebook.
When Facebook failed to communicate with me, I went through PayPal to file a dispute. Well lo and behold, after the “supposed” investigation Paypal sided with Facebook on the charges belonging to me…which they didn’t. Therefore, there was nothing more they could about that. 
I had to jump through a lot of hoops to recover the account, since the hackers successfully managed to change my email address on my account to their email address on the account and I had no way to verify it at that point. All communication would be funneled to their email address.
Please understand me when I tell you I was very disrespected. This was absolutely something out of my control. I reported it to you, and you (Facebook)still would not support me with just trying to get those few lil dollars back. Money that absolutely needed but  those hackers probably would have never missed.

And I am talking about very specific stuff I’ve talked about in messages like texting and Facebook messenger. So what happened to them not datamining us? Sucker burger is nothing but a lying nazi who is stealing peoples information and selling it to advertisers 

First of all when Facebook dating came out I LOVED it, 100% better then any other site I’ve used. But now me and 100s of others have been getting the error “it’s not you, it’s us” or “try taking a break”. I would come on after 1-2 days and click like on one person and instantly get that error. I’ve uninstalled the app, updated the app, logged out and in, cleared the cache and still have it after a week. USELESS!!!!

Second the people who run the app of looking at the reports are useless, there was a picture of a penis on my news feed and when I reported it I got a “this doesn’t go against community standards”. People posting brand new pages that are completely fake, advertising they are a celebrity or doing a give away and to give their credit card info. Facebook allows people to be scammed and their support team will allow these pages to stay up and will not take the reporting seriously.

Third which is the biggest...THE ADS!!! Oh god there is at least 3 ads in everyone’s videos, literally every time you scroll down after 3 posts from friends there is a sponsor ad. There is NO option to hide all ads, no option to skim them down. They have a section where you can hide certain ads but guess what...the moment you do that it will replace that ad with another one. This site clearly still is using people’s private information, it’s allowing people to get scammed and it’s allowing people to make threats, post nudity and pick and choose what to ban.

For one, the app is absolute garbage. You can’t find crap on there. It takes two hours to rummage through the settings to find privacy settings for your profile and whatnot. Not to mention that Facebook spies on you and sells your personal information to third parties for profit. 

That is a gripe I have of them, but not THE gripe I’m writing about. This gripe is about either facebook’s auto moderator, or even an actual person who is employed to watch certain people’s profiles (I don’t know how they do it). 

Last year, there was an argument on a group I’m a part of about the current pandemic. It seemed to be a pretty open debate, so I weighed in with my opinions. Within this debate, there were people with some very radical ideas, while I was basically trying to explain that there needs to be a better way to get information we need from the source, without the news media being the middle man so we could get all the information we need without any twisting of the facts for propaganda’s sake. 

Well, my comment was removed, and I was given a 24 hour ban. Yeah, they just completely skipped the warning and immediately hit me with the ban. 

Fast forward a few months, and somebody was calling me some expletives and saying pretty mean things. I’m not one to report people on the internet, because cmon it’s the internet. I rebutted with some pretty clean words such as stupid, dumb, crappy person, etc. 
Well, my comment was removed and I was hit with a 7 day ban, while their comment stayed. 

Fast forward a couple more months, somebody was explaining something going on with their car. I say “well that’s stupid” and boom, 30 day ban. 

Well here we are again, a month or so later, and the same crap just happened again for the same reason. 

Facebook, I’m tired of your crap. You flag my comments as bullying but you’re literally going after the victim in this situation. Like I said I’m not one to report stuff like that, I just deal with it, it’s the internet, it’s not real.

13765,"(?????????)8 days ago, someone was able to log in to Snapchat account from India (I am based in the US). They successfully logged in from an unknown device, removed my email address and my phone number and proceed to scam my family and friends for $100 Amazon gift cards. I have submitted multiple tickets to Snapchat within that time and all I’ve gotten is an automated reply. No one has looked in to my account or even attempted to assist me. I sent them a screenshot of the scam, because a friend sent it to me. Multiple people have reported my account and guess what it’s still active. This person has had access to my contacts, videos and photos for 8 days while the Snapchat support team ignores me. I created a Twitter hoping that I could get a response from their Twitter account. I finally got a response- after 5 days- they told me to be patient. After 7 days they told me they couldn’t assist me over Twitter and to check my junk inbox for a reply from their team. I went through the process of creating a Twitter just to get a response from their company, don’t you think I’ve been neurotically checking my inbox and junk folder??? I’ve opened up new tickets and responded to the original ones and still nothing. Now I guess this hacker just has free rein of my information till the end of time.

Even the people and account names on quick adds were making sentences when you put the names together in a line being cruel and extremely disrespectful.

13910,"This is one of the worst apps I’ve ever seen. It’s advertised as this great way of connecting with your friends and loved ones but in reality it’s just a data collecting middleman between us, the consumers, and advertising companies. Every heard “when something is free, you’re the product?” The app is designed to be impossible to put down, constantly sucking the user deeper into content rabbit holes by mining our usage data. Every click, every react button, every second the user spends on the app is tracked and used to customize the content to prevent the user from putting it down and used to send us the perfect ad, which advertisers pay top dollar for. It’s the digital version of cigarette branding; a promise of one thing but a reality of horrors no consumer would ever imagine. Of the many side effects of using this app which include depression, anxiety, detachment from reality, etc, is the tearing apart of society as we know it. The app is designed solely to collect data and keep you hooked so it cares nothing that people are much more likely to click on things they hate than things they love, slowly but surely pushing each of us into smaller and smaller, angrier and angrier echo chambers. Detached from reality and consuming our own echos (“customized content”), our society is slowly torn apart as the communication lines between each echo chamber disintegrate further. Every social issue, every human experience is distilled to a data point, a thumbs up or a sarcastic laughing emoji, a click or a scroll. It is a nightmare Kafka himself could have never imagined: a violent melding of human, digital interface, and advertiser into one monstrous, self-serving, self-consuming entity. Every moment we spend hating our fellow man and seeking the dopamine rush of approval in the form of likes, is a second lost to us and a dollar gained by Facebook. Every time we click on or repost things that feel true because we agree with them (which Facebook knows, that’s why it showed that link to you), a stitch in the fabric of our democracy, our society, is torn. And when it is torn, Facebook profits and shows you more of what you want to see. This app is terrible and is actively participating, encouraging for its own gain, the downfall of modern mankind.

13943,"This is a Public service announcement and a review about Facebook… the company better known as Facebook has flagged my email and has disabled my account for no reason at all. Example I went two whole weeks without using Facebook messenger or any associated app or website, I was dormant in using the app and as soon as I logged in I was logged back out automatically and notified I violated their community guidelines. Once I was put on notice I had the option to file a request for a  review of my account where I was then asked to upload a picture of my photo ID, so I managed to regain access to delete that account and created a new account under a different email and two days later was automatically signed out of my account  yet again and was notified that I was using multiple accounts and had to confirm the account I had deleted or permanently loose the account I had just made. I would not recommend this social platform for anybody because they track you using GEO location on your phone, monitor your microphone, and camera, and watch you 24/7  they require your physical address, phone number, and email, they require you to upload a photo ID or birth certificate. Meta previously known as Facebook is in association with 3rd party corporations in China where they take all data collected on you and sell it to big businesses and profit off your rights to use their services. They monitor each like, comment, and message made through Facebook app or messenger. It is not safe and idk why it’s even legal to use in the United States. As far as I’m concerned Facebook is a CIA platform and is only free to the public to monitor and track each person online. They even monitor you when you aren’t using their app. As long as you have the app downloaded on your device regardless online or offline they still watch and monitor you, they track your microphone and your camera so I’d be advised and delete the app, go to something else like MySpace, or something.",adidalmahamud@iut-dhaka.edu,4,tahsinislam@iut-dhaka.edu,1,takiafarhin@iut-dhaka.edu,4,3,Partially Correct,4

You get users to upload pictures, share their favorite thoughts/ideas, and “interact” with other users to gather data to sell go advertisers. Moreover, the biggest data client of FB is likely numerous governments across the world seeking to track and control their citizens. If this isn’t the dystopian nightmare George Orwell warned us about, I’m not sure what could be a better example. 

We use FB to inform families of births, deaths, birthdays, celebrations, and every aspect of our lives, believing we are “interacting” socially with those we choose to share with. FB preys upon our emotions, manipulates us into becoming politically tribal, and generally exploits the precious moments of our lives to make money. You are the product, and the more you are manipulated into interacting, the more money you generate for people who honestly don’t care whether you live or die. 

They have successfully engineered entire populations to voluntarily disclose their lives to the world, oblivious to nefarious actors, oblivious to the fact they are being used to fill the pockets of those who have invested in FB. You thought you were a person using a social network, but you are just a cog in a machine that must be exploited. 

FB, like Twitter and Google, are technofascists who align with brutal regimes across the world to silence dissent, control political narratives, and inevitably perpetual structural violence upon “Othered” populations.

14733,"So, the Pages section of this app isn’t one of the better operating sections. I have a lot of nitpicks, but I’m going to focus on one major complaint. 

My main problem comes from the Page News Feed, where when I try to comment or like a post from a page I follow on the page I run, it comments or likes from my personal account. I also have this problem a lot of the time when replying to comments, and often times have no option to change what name I’m commenting or liking under. 

The problem with replies was easily remedied with the Business Suite app, (that I feel would be much better off as a dedicated app for FB Pages,) the issue of the news feed is still a problem as the Business Suite app doesn’t let us see our pages news feed. 

All and all, I think FB pages would benefit greatly from the “FB Gaming” treatment, with an app entirely dedicated to FB pages with full incorporation of a news feed. The Business Suite app could stay around for its current purpose of managing business pages, but I believe FB pages still need their own app. 

I didn’t have Facebook Page Manager prior to it being changed to Business Suite, so I ave no knowledge of whether or not this was already a thing, but it should be. 

Another way to quickly and easily fix this, while avoiding revamping or creating a new app, would be to put the option to change whether we’re commenting under the page or our personal account in the text bar, similar to that of the emoji, gif, and photo options.",adidalmahamud@iut-dhaka.edu,2,istiaqprodhan02@gmail.com,3,takiafarhin@iut-dhaka.edu,2,3,Partially Correct,2

14905,"1.) Facebook has spent years perfecting the art of making users think they have control over their privacy by putting in a few visible “controls” while constantly adding new undisclosed tools that default to sharing information and tracking users. This pattern means at least once a month, users should be checking all privacy and security settings (which are numerous and onerous), but which they know users won’t do. By playing whack-a-mole privacy settings, FB has collected trillions of data points on hundreds of millions of active daily users. They disingenuously continue to pledge transparency but never have provided it.

2.) Facebook has for years failed to set clear guidelines for what it will censor and what it won’t. More often than not it treats harmful content as free speech and free speech as harmful content. Tue bottom line is always whether the act of censoring a thing will cost their bottom line. If an individual is being bullied, they will do nothing. If something someone posts is a neutral express of art or humanity, they act on vaguely worded policies prohibiting content that shows nudity or other ultra-conservative-sensibility offending content. There’s usually little rhyme or reason other than the opinion of an overworked, traumatized worker on the other side of the planet from the United States. Bottom Line: Facebook is a dishonest broker.

But the political agenda that’s forced on us on Facebook is just absolutely ridiculous. If you say things that they don’t approve of, the algorithms will not work in your favor. There’s a rating/ranking system going on now, sounds just like China. But on a smaller scale. If we let these bigwigs win, it might end up being just like China. It’s so odd but true, Facebook is like it’s own country. 

Thankfully I’m my own boss, I don’t have to worry about being politically correct. There was a time where I was applying for jobs, and every business would ask me if I had a Facebook. When I told them that I didn’t have one at that time, (I was on and off Facebook), they would think that it was weird or suspicious. I really wish people would just get to know you, have a conversation talk over the phone instead of relying on social media where you see the best of everybody. It’s so fake. And it’s not teaching people to communicate properly. Especially bad for children who need to learn that!

I am first generation in USA from the Netherlands, so I was using Facebook to keep in touch with family . But now I’m just so scared and apprehensive to use it that I just signed off and this will probably be the final time. I don’t like how they infringe on your privacy and the amount of ads is just ridiculous now. Data mining, data mining, and more data mining. I freaking hate that! It scared me to hear when you say “bad stuff about the you know what situation.” You will be assigned to a ranking system. And to think they have my name, info etc. CREEPY.

They block such targeted individuals and others from accessing their own Facebook accounts; but requires that any appeal regarding Facebook’s apparent arbitrary action be submitted by the user through the user’s account in order to have their case reviewed.  A “catch twenty-two” blocking the person from resolving whatever it was that initiated Facebook’s action.  
There is no customer service department to contact about “any issue”, outside of having to do so through one’s online Facebook account.  
Furthermore, there is no telephone or email or chat access to a customer service agent for addressing any issue concerning Facebook, unlike more reputable businesses.  
One is thereby locked out of contacting Facebook about such issues without having to do so from one’s account, which one has  been banned access to.  Such action being taken by Facebook without any explanation as to why being proved to the blocked user.  
One is left to guess why one has been locked out of their own Facebook account.  
A most frustrating and fruitless experience.  
Facebook is not worth the headache.  
Why put up with having to walk on eggshells on one’s account, hoping that one does not step on Facebook’s toes.   
Facebook policies, though published, are vague enough for them to interpret them in any way and at any time that suits their own purposes, in what ever situation that may  arise.   
Facebook seems to hold that such published policies fulfills what they view as their responsibility to the users of their so called service.  
Such business practices would seem to be more self-serving to their own biases. 
All of the above is my own personal opinion.  
I truly wish that I had first checked the 1000+ reviews of Facebook on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website.  
The reviews of Facebook filed with the BBB were most illuminating.  Something I stumbled upon when I went to the BBB website to submit my own review.  Unfortunately this insight gained from the BBB website came after the fact.  It certainly would have given me pause before choosing whether get involved with them, or not.  
Were there an alternative social media to using this unregulated internet monopoly (Facebook), I would happily give them a try instead.  
My advice? Proceed with utmost caution... and do not be surprised when your greatest Facebook nightmare materializes - being cutoff from an avenue of social contact with one’s family and friends.  
In my opinion emails and snail mail offers a much more pleasurable and hassle free experience than does Facebook.

No targeting, no data mining, you just got shown the ad. They made money that way, it worked, but that wasn’t enough. Why make money ethically when you can abuse people’s rights and make more money? 

You make it extremely difficult to delete profiles, and honestly I have my doubts whether or not that data is truly deleted. That makes it essentially impossible for older people, who aren’t tech savvy. 

Facebook, much like google, is a predatory company. It’s data harvesting practices are incredibly similar to what a virus would do. Dig and gather as much data as possible so they can utilize that information to best profit off the individual they’re targeting.

I want to make it clear that I have no intentions of using my Facebook account for social purposes. It is strictly for oculus and nothing else. I also wanna make it known that Facebook does not have my consent to utilize the cameras on my oculus headset to view anything within my house, nor do they have my consent to use the microphone in my headset to eavesdrop on me in my house. Any violation of my privacy in this manner by Facebook will likely be met with legal action. Facebook has proven time and time again that they do not truly respect their user’s right to privacy (they literally sell our personal data), nor do they respect their users right to free expression ( unless you are expressing views that they agree with). I am deeply offended by the fact that Facebook sees fit to force me to utilize a service that I most definitely do not want to utilize just so I can continue to utilize a service that I have been using literally since it first came out. As soon as I can find a reasonable/affordable alternative to oculus VR I assure you with absolute certainty that my Facebook account will be deleted, and every oculus headset I own ( I literally own every version I’ve been with Oculus since day one) will be rendered unusable and tossed in the trash. I have already transitioned to steam for all future vr game purchases in preparation for this. If they deny me my right to continue using Steam for gaming then my VR headset will simply go in the trash faster.",atikshahriar@iut-dhaka.edu,2,tahsinislam@iut-dhaka.edu,4,labibahhoque@iut-dhaka.edu,4,3,Partially Correct,4
18765,"Facebook has gone way to far with its targeted advertising, and invasion of privacy. They pretend to support free speech and doing what you want, but in reality they censor anything that doesn’t support their political views. 

Additionally their security is terrible, millions of accounts get hacked regularly and nothing is done about it. My sisters account just got hacked, she’s locked out, and hackers want her to send them money to get back in. She tried customer support, reporting her account. No one will talk to her, there isn&#39;t anyone at Facebook to help users. Despite her sending her photo Id to an automated system to get her account back, Facebook still hasn’t done anything. All her pictures from years of her life that were on there are gone.

4.Shocking Stories:

Content that otherwise does not violate our COVID-19 or vaccine policies above but that shares potentially or actually true events or facts that raise safety concerns, indicated by sharing personal anecdotes or news events of severe adverse events, either in hyperbolic terms or without context.

Ex: “My friend got the vaccine and now has Bell’s Palsy, be warned!”
Think about that. TRUE stories that go against a certain narrative is against their community standards. And that isn’t all. Their community standards create a place where it’s just an echo chamber of one type of idea or thought and sharing facts, evidence, data or statistics even if it’s straight from the CDC or FDA will get you banned or your content deleted.

The updating issues stem from updated listing items. Items on discount don't always show to the public.

There isn't a way to filter unread messages and a whole host of notifications give you an unread message notification.

They deemed that “goes against Facebook standards” because I said women are disgusting. Well as a woman and an American I have every right to say that. I’ve used woman’s bathroom for nearly a half century. I think I can honestly say they’re gross.

19399,"(?????????)The only reason my Facebook account exists is because Facebook bought out Oculus and now forces oculus VR users (wether they want to or not) to have Facebook accounts just to be able to use their systems. I wish I could say that Facebook at least improved upon the system, but unfortunately the longer they have control of the of the oculus vr system the more it feels like a digital cage where big brother controls your every move. As someone who has been an oculus user since day one I have acquired a lot of games. So until I can find a viable alternative I am stuck using this shamelessly censored and politically biased service that I have no desire what-so-ever to use. I want to make it clear that I have no intentions of using my Facebook account for social purposes. It is strictly for oculus and nothing else. I also wanna make it known that Facebook does not have my consent to utilize the cameras on my oculus headset to view anything within my house, nor do they have my consent to use the microphone in my headset to eavesdrop on me in my house. Any violation of my privacy in this manner by Facebook will likely be met with legal action. Facebook has proven time and time again that they do not truly respect their user’s right to privacy (they literally sell our personal data), nor do they respect their users right to free expression ( unless you are expressing views that they agree with). I am deeply offended by the fact that Facebook sees fit to force me to utilize a service that I most definitely do not want to utilize just so I can continue to utilize a service that I have been using literally since it first came out. As soon as I can find a reasonable/affordable alternative to oculus VR I assure you with absolute certainty that my Facebook account will be deleted, and every oculus headset I own ( I literally own every version I’ve been with Oculus since day one) will be rendered unusable and tossed in the trash. I have already transitioned to steam for all future vr game purchases in preparation for this.

Someone (from SINGAPORE!!!) hacked my account and changed my password. I could not access my own account. I was never notified that this change took place until it had already happened, and when they sent me a code, all it did was took me to a page to create a new account. After going in circles several times, I created a new account, and the same thing happened again. When I used Facebook “support” they were useless. And Facebook doesn’t have live chat support or phone support. Hey Zuck! How about installing safeguards…red flags that will prevent the hacking?! For example, I live in the USA, and that’s were my computer/cell phones have logged on since 2009. So why and how is it someone sitting in a seedy, smoke-filled backroom in Singapore could get away with hacking my account? I see a certain red flag right there. Why haven’t you implemented software that would catch that and stop it, and notify the account holder BEFORE the hacking takes place?

The entire facebook platform uses location history data (down to the hour), as well as microphone data, ect, and sells your personal information that they gather from this data to 3rd party advertisers such as Wish. They then spam your feed with excessive advertsements of things that are EXTREMELY relevant to your life in general. This is called “personalized advertisements.”
Many apps/services do it, but facebook has an entirely malicious way of doing it, based on my experience.

 If you don’t upload a picture of your face to the platform after a certain time frame of creating an account, they ask that you upload a picture of your drivers license/ ID card to confirm your identity. Facebook is in legal no position to ask for this information to confirm you are who you say. But the loopholes they’ve made in their terms of service have made it to where if you accept the terms, they are no longer in the wrong for asking for this information legally, so it’s up to the users discretion whether or not they want to proceed.

I have been locked out of my account for months. I updated to iOS 15 and Google Authenticator duplicated my security tokens/keys. I deleted the duplicates; but, after a reboot of the device all of my Google Authenticator tokens/keys were gone.

Every other online account has been salvaged, but you, Facebook, are impossible to reach. I have submitted requests in your 500 character limit help pages to no avail. I reached out to Oculus, another Meta company, and got a real live person but they couldn't help me connect my Oculus to my Facebook account.

I have submitted multiple forms of government issued ID *numerous* times through your Checkpoint. I get a link by email, enter my password and end up in the same infinite loop through your Checkpoint. I do not have a password issue. I do not have an issue proving my identity. I have a problem due to a software issue with Google Authenticator, iOS, and your Checkpoint that doesn't know the difference between a compromised security token and a forgotten password. 

I would like my data. As the data creator I am requesting a full copy of the information, photos and all, that I imputed into your web service over the course of the last 13+ years.

Please give me my meta and all the info attached to it.

They never truly cared about their customers in the first place, which is why Zuck sold our data to third party companies and consistently tries every way possible to control our lives by collecting data, influencing and conditioning our way of thinking by the crap that is forced fed to us in the feed. The nuanced settings now compared to when Facebook originally launched in the 2000s is a clear cut example of how clustered Facebook as a whole has become. When they look back in history, they will realize they really screwed up when Trump started to take office. Also the dating app isn’t working for me, probably because I’m white and Facebook knows I’m not vaccined and voted for Trump because you know, they’re spying on my life just like they’re spying on everyone else’s. Facebook values profit, social media domination, forcing train of thought into common opinion, political influence, and data gold mining for third party companies. 1984 = Facebook.

Fact checkers on memes, being banned for something silly, very easy to catfish someone or have fake accounts bouncing around with your photos. It’s become an addiction for people of all ages, yes, even your grandmother scrolls endlessly and mindlessly for hours at a time.

That’s fine and dandy though. People cause drama ?????it&#39;s happened ever since the days of Myspace but Facebook should hold itself accountable when it comes to users privacy. It&#39;s pretty eerie that I can mention a product to a friend with my phone not being used to then pick it up and find an add for said product or even a destination. 

To sum it up Facebook is just like a huge database with all of you, your kid, mom, dad, sister and brothers information for anyone to find. Bring back the simple days of Myspace!

People should be free to say what they think. The only time a post should he removed is if there is a direct threat to another person or if there is a post that suggests harm to another individual. Take notice there is a huge difference between showing a meme about a cop being slaughtered with a knife (yes FB allowed it) and posts talking about a historical event where people were murdered, such as the holocaust or Ottoman Empire. FB deploys so called Fact checkers who wouldn’t know the facts if it hit them over the head. Those Fact checkers have the nerve to go into your private page! They shamefully try to steal public opinion. I find this very disturbing that fact checkers can get into people’s private accounts. If you are looking for a safe social media platform where you can say what you think without being harassed, this isn’t it. There are some amazing new platforms out there that protect free speech.

Whenever one group, left or right think they have all power, all wisdom, and can dictate to everyone else what to think and to say, their ends up being oppression, then violence. 
Face book now seems to want to control the narrative, suppress information, target certain groups and people with censorship or just wiping them out completely by kicking them of this and any other platforms they seem to have influence over. 
It makes me sick. 
I don’t care who the president is, if you let anarchist criminals bent on destruction, violence, (these are white youth burning down businesses owned by immigrants) while wearing black hoods, then live stream it on face book, promoting their violence and truly destructive ideology, face book seems to have no problem with that, but when it comes to elections, picking our own leaders, they seem to think they know what’s best for all of us, what we can see, what ideas we can read or speakers we can here.
Facebook isn’t God, although they seem to think they are the arbiters of truth, they are doing exactly what their founder under oath said they were not. Talk about election interference. Facebook should be held accountable. 
Facebook was the pawn of Russia during the last election, now this election, their suppression of information was so out in the open, it makes me sick.

30 year old tech tyrants that aim to control what I can read, suppress information I need to make important decisions, control the minds of our kids, and silence anyone they deem dangerous for any reason, that’s the start of communist like control.

Go ahead and refresh your feed multiple times over a few seconds while you’re at it. There’s a very good chance it will rearrange  itself almost every time. 

It’s obvious Facebook has a motive to leave News Feed the way it is. There have been settings in the past that would allow you to switch to most recent, but these options have all but moved to different dimensions, unable to be found, or disappeared entirely.

21422,"The ecosystem of the network is based on profiting from viral content, which, in particular, contains features of conspiracy theory, misogyny and racism and, as a result, causes pronounced negative emotions.  The network's algorithms, designed with the goal of ""maximizing user engagement"" on apps, amplify and promote such content.

  Because people are more likely to ""click"" on sensational and outrageous content, social media's ""recommendation systems"" can edit the user down a ""rabbit hole"" of toxic accumulation.
In addition, in many countries FB is the only way to draw attention to important social problems and solve them.  In totalitarian countries, the network is often almost the only tool to talk about human rights violations, to be heard and to call for help from the international community.

At the same time, when you try to post content that informs about the cruelty of the totalitarian regime, your materials are thoughtlessly, without proper evaluation, are deleted.

Content evaluation for compliance with community standards is carried out absolutely thoughtlessly by machines, when you try to appeal, they ignore you.
    
     The main problem is that Facebook occupies an extremely important place in people's lives.  At the same time, users themselves do not have the tools to influence the social network and control mechanisms for how their personal data is used and what algorithms form our information space.

The notifications have been getting weirder and weirder.

Back in the day, Facebook sent out notifications if a friend tagged you in a post, commented on one of your pictures, or liked something you shared/Posted. Nowadays, you get “all notifications” from strangers commenting in a group you both follow. 

Non-priority notifications feel very disingenuous. 

I tried switching my notifications to “priority” and was glitched out of getting any notifications for weeks. I would get on Facebook and see that someone tagged me in something, but I would have no notifications at all.
